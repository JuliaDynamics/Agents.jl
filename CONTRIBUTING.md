# Previewing Documentation Edits

Modifications to the documentation can be previewed by building the documentation locally, which is made possible by a script located in docs/make.jl. The Documenter package is required and can be installed by running `import Pkg; Pkg.add("Documenter")` in a REPL session. Then the documentation can be built and previewed in build/ first by running `julia docs/make.jl` from a terminal.
