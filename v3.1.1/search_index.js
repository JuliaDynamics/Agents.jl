Small changes in the input to complex systems or the behavior of its agents can lead to large changes in outcome. That is to say, a complex system's behavior is nonlinear, and that it is not only the sum of the behavior of its elements.

Agents can be from different social groups. Agents are happy/unhappy based on the fraction of their neighbors that belong to the same group as they are. If they are unhappy, they keep moving to new locations until they are happy. Schelling's model shows that even small preferences of agents to have neighbors belonging to the same group (e.g. preferring that at least 30% of neighbors to be in the same group) could lead to total segregation of neighborhoods. This is an example of emergent behavior from simple interactions of agents that can only be captured in an agent-based model.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Citation-1","page":"Introduction","title":"Citation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"If you use this package in a publication, please cite the paper below:","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"R.
