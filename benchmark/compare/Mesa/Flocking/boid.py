class Boid(Agent):
    """
    A Boid-style flocker agent.

    The agent follows three behaviors to flock:
        - Cohesion: steering towards neighboring agents.
        - Separation: avoiding getting too close to any other agent.
        - Alignment: try to fly in the same direction as the neighbors.

    Boids have a vision that defines the radius in which they look for their
    neighbors to flock with. Their speed (a scalar) and velocity (a vector)
    define their movement. Separation is their desired minimum distance from
    any other Boid.
