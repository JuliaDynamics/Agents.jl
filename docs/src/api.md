# API

The API of Agents.jl is defined on top of the fundamental structures  [`AgentBasedModel`](@ref), [Space](@ref Space), [`AbstractAgent`](@ref) which are described in the [Tutorial](@ref) page.

## Agent/model retrieval
```@docs
getindex(::ABM, ::Integer)
getproperty(::ABM, ::Symbol)
random_agent
nagents
allagents
allids
```

## Model-agent interaction
The following API is mostly universal across all types of [Space](@ref Space).
Only some specific methods are exclusive to a specific type of space.

### Adding agents
```@docs
add_agent!
add_agent_pos!
nextid
random_position
```

### Moving and killing agents
```@docs
move_agent!
kill_agent!
genocide!
sample!
```

## Local area
```@docs
nearby_ids
nearby_positions
edistance
walk!
```

### WARNING: Iteration

Most iteration in Agents.jl is **dynamic** and **lazy**, when possible, for performance reasons.

**Dynamic** means that when iterating over the result of e.g. the [`ids_in_position`](@ref) function, the iterator will be affected by actions that would alter its contents.
Specifically, imagine the scenario
```@example docs
using Agents
mutable struct Agent <: AbstractAgent
    id::Int
    pos::NTuple{4, Int}
end

model = ABM(Agent, GridSpace((5, 5, 5, 5)))
add_agent!((1, 1, 1, 1), model)
add_agent!((1, 1, 1, 1), model)
add_agent!((2, 1, 1, 1), model)
for id in ids_in_position((1, 1, 1, 1), model)
    kill_agent!(id, model)
end
collect(allids(model))
```
You will notice that only 1 agent got killed. This is simply because the final state of the iteration of `ids_in_position` was reached unnaturally, because the length of its output was reduced by 1 *during* iteration.
To avoid problems like these, you need to `copy` the iterator to have a non dynamic version.

**Lazy** means that when possible the outputs of the iteration are not collected and instead are generated on the fly.
A good example to illustrate this is [`nearby_ids`](@ref), where doing something like
```julia
a = random_agent(model)
sort!(nearby_ids(random_agent(model), model))
```
leads to error, since you cannot `sort!` the returned iterator. This can be easily solved by adding a `collect` in between:
```@example docs
a = random_agent(model)
sort!(collect(nearby_agents(a, model)))
```

## Discrete space exclusives
```@docs
positions
ids_in_position
agents_in_position
fill_space!
has_empty_positions
empty_positions
random_empty
add_agent_single!
move_agent_single!
isempty(::Integer, ::ABM)
```

## Continuous space exclusives
```@docs
interacting_pairs
nearest_neighbor
elastic_collision!
```

## Graph space exclusives
```@docs
add_edge!
add_node!
rem_node!
```

## Parameter scanning
```@docs
paramscan
```

## Data collection
The central simulation function is [`run!`](@ref), which is mentioned in our [Tutorial](@ref).
But there are other functions that are related to simulations listed here.
```@docs
init_agent_dataframe
collect_agent_data!
init_model_dataframe
collect_model_data!
aggname
```
For example, the core loop of `run!` is just
```julia
df_agent = init_agent_dataframe(model, adata)
df_model = init_model_dataframe(model, mdata)

s = 0
while until(s, n, model)
  if should_we_collect(s, model, when)
      collect_agent_data!(df_agent, model, adata, s)
  end
  if should_we_collect(s, model, when_model)
      collect_model_data!(df_model, model, mdata, s)
  end
  step!(model, agent_step!, model_step!, 1)
  s += 1
end
return df_agent, df_model
```
(here `until` and `should_we_collect` are internal functions)

## [Schedulers](@id Schedulers)
The schedulers of Agents.jl have a very simple interface.
All schedulers are functions, that take as an input the ABM and return an iterator over agent IDs.
Notice that this iterator can be a "true" iterator (non-allocated) or can be just a standard vector of IDs.
You can define your own scheduler according to this API and use it when making an [`AgentBasedModel`](@ref).
You can also use the function `schedule(model)` to obtain the scheduled ID list, if you prefer to write your own `step!`-like loop.

Also notice that you can use [Function-like-objects](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1.5/manual/methods/#Function-like-objects) to make your scheduling possible of arbitrary events.
For example, imagine that after the `n`-th step of your simulation you want to fundamentally change the order of agents. To achieve this you can define
```julia
mutable struct MyScheduler
    n::Int # step number
    w::Float64
end
```
and then define a calling method for it like so
```julia
function (ms::MyScheduler)(model::ABM)
    ms.n += 1 # increment internal counter by 1 each time its called
              # be careful to use a *new* instance of this scheduler when plotting!
    if ms.n < 10
        return allids(model)) # order doesn't matter in this case
    else
        ids = collect(allids(model))
        # filter all ids whose agents have `w` less than some amount
        filter!(id -> model[id].w < ms.w, ids)
        return ids
    end
end
```
and pass it to e.g. `step!` by initializing it
```julia
ms = MyScheduler(100, 0.5)
run!(model, agentstep, modelstep, 100; scheduler = ms)
```

### Predefined schedulers
Some useful schedulers are available below as part of the Agents.jl public API:
```@docs
fastest
by_id
random_activation
partial_activation
property_activation
by_type
```

## Plotting
Plotting functionality comes from `AgentsPlots`, which uses Plots.jl. You need to install both `AgentsPlots`, as well as a plotting backend (we use GR) to use the following functions.

The version of `AgentsPlots` is:
```@example versions
using Pkg
Pkg.status("AgentsPlots")
```

```@docs
plotabm
```
