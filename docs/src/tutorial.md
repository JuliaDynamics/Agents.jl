In Agents.jl a central structure called `AgentBasedModel` contains all data of a simulation and maps unique IDs (integers) to agent instances.
During the simulation, the model evolves in discrete steps. During one step, the user decides which agents will act, how will they act, how many times, and whether any model-level properties will be adjusted.
Once the time evolution is defined, collecting data during time evolution is straightforward by simply stating which data should be collected.

In the spirit of simple design, all of this is done by defining simple Julia data types, like basic functions, structs and dictionaries.

To set up an ABM simulation in Agents.jl, a user only needs to follow these steps:

1. Choose in what kind of space the agents will live in, for example a graph, a grid, etc. Several spaces are provided by Agents.jl and can be initialized immediately.
2. Define the agent type (or types, for mixed models) that will populate the ABM. Agent types are standard Julia `mutable struct` that are created with [`@agent`](@ref). The types must contain some mandatory fields, which is ensured by using [`@agent`](@ref). The remaining fields of the agent type are up to user's choice.
3. The created agent type, the chosen space, optional additional model level properties, and other simulation tuning properties like schedulers or random number generators, are given to our universal structure [`AgentBasedModel`](@ref). This instance defines the model within an Agents.jl simulation.
4. Provide functions that govern the time evolution of the ABM. A user can provide an agent-stepping function, that acts on each agent one by one, and/or a model-stepping function, that steps the entire model as a whole. These functions are standard Julia functions that take advantage of the Agents.jl [API](@ref). Once these functions are created, they are simply passed to [`step!`](@ref) to evolve the model.
5. _(Optional)_ Visualize the model and animate its time evolution. This can help checking that the model behaves as expected and there aren't any mistakes, or can be used in making figures for a paper/presentation.
6. Collect data. To do this, specify which data should be collected, by providing one standard Julia `Vector` of data-to-collect for agents, for example `[:mood, :wealth]`, and another one for the model. The agent data names are given as the keyword `adata` and the model as keyword `mdata` to the function [`run!`](@ref). This function outputs collected data in the form of a `DataFrame`.

If you're planning of running massive simulations, it might be worth having a look at the [Performance Tips](@ref) after familiarizing yourself with Agents.jl.


## [1. The space](@id Space)
Agents.jl offers several possibilities for the space the agents live in.
In addition, it is straightforward to implement a fundamentally new type of space, see [Creating a new space type](@ref).

The available spaces are listed in the [Available spaces](@ref) part of the API.
An example of a space is [`OpenStreetMapSpace`](@ref). It is based on Open Street Map, where agents are confined to move along streets of the map, using real-world values for the length of each street.

After deciding on the space, one simply initializes an instance of a space, e.g. with `grid = GridSpace((10, 10))` and passes that into [`AgentBasedModel`](@ref). See each individual space for all its possible arguments.


## 2. The agent type(s)

@agent
AbstractAgent
```

## 3. The model
Once an agent is created (typically by instantiating a struct generated with [`@agent`](@ref)), it can be added to a model using [`add_agent!`](@ref).
Then, the agent can interact with the model and the space further by using e.g. [`move_agent!`](@ref) or [`kill_agent!`](@ref).
The "model" here stands for an instance of [`AgentBasedModel`](@ref).

```@docs
AgentBasedModel
```


## 4. Evolving the model

In Agents.jl, an agent based model should be accompanied with least one and at most two stepping functions.
An _agent step function_ is required by default.
Such an agent step function defines what happens to an agent when it activates.
Sometimes we also need a function that changes all agents at once, or changes a model property. In such cases, we can also provide a _model step function_.

An agent step function must accept two arguments: first, an agent instance, and second, a model instance.

The model step function must accept one argument, that is the model.
To use only a model step function, users can use the built-in [`dummystep`](@ref) as the agent step function. This is typically the case for [Advanced stepping](@ref).

The stepping functions are created using the [API](@ref) functions, and the Examples hosted in this documentation showcase several different variants.

After you have defined the stepping functions functions, you can evolve your model with `step!`:
```@docs
step!
dummystep
```

### Advanced stepping
!!! note "Current step number"
    Notice that the current step number is not explicitly given to the `model_step!`
    function, because this is useful only for a subset of ABMs. If you need the
    step information, implement this by adding a counting parameter into the model
    `properties`, and incrementing it by 1 each time `model_step!` is called.
    An example can be seen in the `model_step!` function of [Daisyworld](@ref),
    where a `tick` is increased at each step.

The interface of [`step!`](@ref), which allows the option of both `agent_step!` and `model_step!` is driven mostly by convenience. In principle, the `model_step!` function by itself can perform all operations related with stepping the ABM.
However, for many models, this simplified approach offers the benefit of not having to write an explicit loop over existing agents inside the `model_step!`.
Most of the examples in our documentation can be expressed using an independent `agent_step!` and `model_step!` function.

On the other hand, more advanced models require special handling for scheduling, or may need to schedule several times and act on different subsets of agents with different functions.
In such a scenario, it is more sensible to provide only a `model_step!` function (and use `dummystep` as `agent_step!`), where all configuration is contained within.
Notice that if you follow this road, the argument `scheduler` given to [`AgentBasedModel`](@ref) somewhat loses its meaning.

Here is an example:
```julia
function complex_step!(model)
    for id in scheduler1(model)
        agent_step1!(model[id], model)
    end
    intermediate_model_action!(model)
    for id in scheduler2(model)
        agent_step2!(model[id], model)
    end
    if model.step_counter % 100 == 0
        model_action_every_100_steps!(model)
    end
    final_model_action!(model)
end

step!(model, dummystep, complex_step!, n)
```

For defining your own schedulers, see [Schedulers](@ref).

## 5. Visualizations
Once you have defined a model and the stepping functions you can visualize the model statically or animate its time evolution straightforwardly in ~5 lines of code. This is discussed in a different page: [Visualizations and Animations for Agent Based Models](@ref). Furthermore, all models in the Examples showcase plotting.

## 6. Collecting data
Running the model and collecting data while the model runs is done with the [`run!`](@ref) function. Besides `run!`, there is also the [`paramscan`](@ref) function that performs data collection while scanning ranges of the parameters of the model, and the [`ensemblerun!`](@ref) that performs ensemble simulations and data collection.

```@docs
run!
```

The [`run!`](@ref) function has been designed for maximum flexibility: nearly all scenarios of data collection are possible whether you need agent data, model data, aggregated data, or arbitrary combinations.

Nevertheless, we also expose a simple data-collection API (see [Data collection](@ref)), that gives users even more flexibility, allowing them to make their own "data collection loops" arbitrarily calling `step!` and collecting data as, and when, needed.

As your models become more complex, it may not be advantageous to use lots of helper functions in the global scope to assist with data collection.
If this is the case in your model, here's a helpful tip to keep things clean: use a generator function to collect data as instructed in the documentation string of [`run!`](@ref). For example:

```julia
function assets(model)
    total_savings(model) = model.bank_balance + sum(model.assets)
    function stategy(model)
        if model.year == 0
            return model.initial_strategy
        else
            return get_strategy(model)
        end
    end
    return [:age, :details, total_savings, strategy]
end
run!(model, agent_step!, model_step!, 10; mdata = assets)
```

## Seeding and Random numbers

Each model created by [`AgentBasedModel`](@ref) provides a random number generator pool `model.rng` which by default coincides with the global RNG.
For performance and reproducibility reasons, one should never use `rand()` without using a pool, thus throughout our examples we use `rand(model.rng)` or `rand(model.rng, 1:10, 100)`, etc.

Another benefit of this approach is deterministic models that can be run again and yield the same output.
To do this, always pass a specifically seeded RNG to the model creation, e.g. `rng = Random.MersenneTwister(1234)`.

Passing `RandomDevice()` will use the system's entropy source (coupled with hardware like [TrueRNG](https://ubld.it/truerng_v3) will invoke a true random source, rather than pseudo-random methods like `MersenneTwister`). Models using this method cannot be repeatable, but avoid potential biases of pseudo-randomness.

## An educative example
A simple, education-oriented example of using the basic Agents.jl API is given in [Schelling's segregation model](@ref).
