In their book, Epstein & Axtell (1996) present a computational model where a heterogeneous population of autonomous agents compete for renewable resources that are unequally distributed over a 2-dimensional environment. Agents in the model are autonomous in that they are not governed by any central authority and they are heterogeneous in that they differ in their genetic attributes and their initial environmental endowments (e.g. their initial location and wealth). The model grows in complexity through the different chapters of the book as the agents are given the ability to engage in new activities such as sex, cultural exchange, trade, combat, disease transmission, etc. The core of Sugarscape has provided the basis for various extensions to study e.g. norm formation through cultural diffusion (Flentge et al. 2001) and the emergence of communication and cooperation in artificial societies (Buzing et al. 2005).

In addition, strong support is provided for representing spatial properties in a model that contains a ContinuousSpace. Spatial properties (which typically are contained in  the model properties) can either be functions of the position vector, f(pos) = value, or AbstractArrays, representing discretizations of  spatial data that may not be available in analytic form. In the latter case, the position is automatically mapped into the discretization represented by the array.

The functionality related to Open Street Map spaces is in the submodule OSM.\n\nThis space represents the underlying map as a continuous entity choosing accuracy over performance by explicitly taking into account that every intersection is connected by a road with a finite length in meters. An example of its usage can be found in Zombie Outbreak. Nevertheless, all functions that target DiscreteSpaces apply here as well, e.g. positions. The discrete part are the underlying road intersections, that are represented by a graph.\n\nMuch of the functionality of this space is provided by interfacing with OpenStreetMapX.jl, for example the two keyword arguments use_cache = false and trim_to_connected_graph = true can be passed into the OpenStreetMapX.get_map_data function.\n\nFor details on how to obtain an OSM file for your use case, consult the OpenStreetMapX.jl README. We provide a variable OSM.TEST_MAP to use as a path for testing.\n\nIf your solution can tolerate routes to and from intersections only without caring for the continuity of the roads in between, a faster implementation can be achieved by using the graph representation of your map provided by OpenStreetMapX.jl. For tips on how to implement this, see our integration example: Social networks with LightGraphs.jl.\n\nThe OSMAgent\n\nThe base properties for an agent residing on an OSMSpace are as follows:\n\nmutable struct OSMAgent <: AbstractAgent\n    id::Int\n    pos::Tuple{Int,Int,Float64}\n    route::Vector{Int}\n    destination::Tuple{Int,Int,Float64}\nend\n\nCurrent position and destination tuples are represented as (start intersection index, finish intersection index, distance travelled in meters).

Some possible scenarios where this may be required are:\n\nYour properties contain functions (or any type not supported by JLD2.jl). These may not be (de)serialized correctly. This could result in checkpoint files that cannot be loaded back in, or contain reconstructed types that do not retain their data/functionality.\nYour properties contain data that can be recalculated during deserialization. Omitting such properties can reduce the size of the checkpoint file, at the expense of some extra computation at deserialization.\n\nIf your model properties do not fall in the above scenarios, you do not need to use this function.\n\nThis function is not called recursively on every type/value during serialization. The final serialization functionality is enabled by JLD2.jl. To define custom serialization for every occurence of a specific type (such as agent structs), refer to the Custom Serialization section of JLD2.jl documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"devdocs/#Agents.AgentsIO.from_serializable","page":"Developer Docs","title":"Agents.AgentsIO.from_serializable","text":"AgentsIO.from_serializable(t; kwargs...)\n\nGiven a value in its serializable form, return the original version.

Requires Agents.\n\nReturn the overarching fig object, as well as a struct abmstepper that can be used to interactively animate the evolution of the ABM and combine it with other subplots. The figure is not displayed by default, you need to either return fig as a last statement in your functions or simply call display(fig). Notice that models with DiscreteSpace are plotted starting from 0 to n, with n the space size along each dimension.\n\nTo progress the ABM plot n steps simply do:\n\nAgents.step!(abmstepper, model, agent_step!, model_step!, n)\n\nYou can still call this function with n=0 to update the plot for a new model, without doing any stepping. From fig you can obtain the plotted axis (to e.g. turn off ticks, etc.) using ax = content(fig[1, 1]).

It is assumed that the origin (0, 0) is the agent's position when creating the polygon. In this case, the keyword as is meaningless, as each polygon has its own size. Use the functions scale, rotate2D to transform this polygon.\n3D models currently do not support having different markers. As a result, am cannot be a function. It should be a Mesh or 3D primitive (such as Sphere or Rect3D).\nscheduler = model.scheduler: decides the plotting order of agents (which matters only if there is overlap).\noffset = nothing: If not nothing, it must be a function taking as an input an agent and outputting an offset position vector to be added to the agent's position (which matters only if there is overlap).\nscatterkwargs = (): Additional keyword arguments propagated to the scatter plot. If am is/returns Polygons, then these arguments are propagated to a poly plot.\n\nModel and figure related keywords\n\nheatarray = nothing : A keyword that plots a heatmap over the space. Its values can be standard data accessors given to functions like run!, i.e. either a symbol (directly obtain model property) or a function of the model. The returned data must be a matrix of the same size as the underlying space. For example heatarray = :temperature is used in the Daisyworld example.

Small changes in the input to complex systems or the behavior of its agents can lead to large changes in outcome. That is to say, a complex system's behavior is nonlinear, and that it is not only the sum of the behavior of its elements.

Agents can be from different social groups. Agents are happy/unhappy based on the fraction of their neighbors that belong to the same group as they are. If they are unhappy, they keep moving to new locations until they are happy. Schelling's model shows that even small preferences of agents to have neighbors belonging to the same group (e.g. preferring that at least 30% of neighbors to be in the same group) could lead to total segregation of neighborhoods.

Return the data as two DataFrames, one for agent-level data and one for model-level data.\n\nData-deciding keywords\n\nadata::Vector means \"agent data to collect\". If an entry is a Symbol, e.g. :weight, then the data for this entry is agent's field weight. If an entry is a Function, e.g. f, then the data for this entry is just f(a) for each agent a. The resulting dataframe columns are named with the input symbol (here :weight, :f).\nadata::Vector{<:Tuple}: if adata is a vector of tuples instead, data aggregation is done over the agent properties.\nFor each 2-tuple, the first entry is the \"key\" (any entry like the ones mentioned above, e.g. :weight, f). The second entry is an aggregating function that aggregates the key, e.g. mean, maximum. So, continuing from the above example, we would have adata = [(:weight, mean), (f, maximum)].\nIt's also possible to provide a 3-tuple, with the third entry being a conditional function (returning a Bool), which assesses if each agent should be included in the aggregate. For example: x_pos(a) = a.pos[1]>5 with (:weight, mean, x_pos) will result in the average weight of agents conditional on their x-position being greater than 5.\nThe resulting data name columns use the function dataname. They create something like :mean_weight or :maximum_f_x_pos. In addition, you can use anonymous functions in a list comprehension to assign elements of an array into different columns: adata = [(a)->(a.interesting_array[i]) for i=1:N]. Column names can also be renamed with DataFrames.rename! after data is collected.\nNotice: Aggregating only works if there are agents to be aggregated over. If you remove agents during model run, you should modify the aggregating functions. E.g. instead of passing mean, pass mymean(a) = isempty(a) ? 0.0 : mean(a).\nmdata::Vector means \"model data to collect\" and works exactly like adata. For the model, no aggregation is possible (nothing to aggregate over).\nmdata::Function use a generator function that accepts model as input and provides a Vector. Useful in combination with an ensemblerun! call that requires a generator function.\n\nBy default both keywords are nothing, i.e. nothing is collected/aggregated.\n\nMixed-Models\n\nFor mixed-models, the adata keyword has some additional options & properties.   An additional column agent_type will be placed in the output   dataframe.\n\nIn the case that data is needed for one agent type that does not exist   in a second agent type, missing values will be added to the dataframe.\n\nWarning: Since this option is inherently type unstable, try to avoid this   in a performance critical situation.\n\nAggregate functions will fail if missing values are not handled explicitly.   If a1.weight but a2 (type: Agent2) has no weight, use   a2(a) = a isa Agent2; adata = [(:weight, sum, a2)] to filter out the missing results.\n\nOther keywords\n\nwhen=true : at which steps s to perform the data collection and processing. A lot of flexibility is offered based on the type of when. If when::Vector, then data are collect if s ∈ when. Otherwise data are collected if when(model, s) returns true. By default data are collected in every step.\nwhen_model = when : same as when but for model data.\nobtainer = identity : method to transfer collected data to the DataFrame. Typically only change this to copy if some data are mutable containers (e.g. Vector) which change during evolution, or deepcopy if some data are nested mutable containers.
