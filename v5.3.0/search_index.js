See also abmvideo and abmexploration.\n\nKeyword arguments\n\nAgent related\n\nac, as, am : These three keywords decide the color, size, and marker, that each agent will be plotted as. They can each be either a constant or a function, which takes as an input a single agent and outputs the corresponding value.\nUsing constants: ac = \"#338c54\", as = 10, am = :diamond\nUsing functions:\nac(a) = a.status == :S ? \"#2b2b33\" : a.status == :I ? \"#bf2642\" : \"#338c54\"\nas(a) = 10rand()\nam(a) = a.status == :S ? :circle : a.status == :I ? :diamond : :rect\nNotice that for 2D models, am can be/return a Polygon instance, which plots each agent as an arbitrary polygon. It is assumed that the origin (0, 0) is the agent's position when creating the polygon. In this case, the keyword as is meaningless, as each polygon has its own size. Use the functions scale, rotate2D to transform this polygon.\n3D models currently do not support having different markers. As a result, am cannot be a function. It should be a Mesh or 3D primitive (such as Sphere or Rect3D).\noffset = nothing : If not nothing, it must be a function taking as an input an agent and outputting an offset position tuple to be added to the agent's position (which matters only if there is overlap).\nscatterkwargs = () : Additional keyword arguments propagated to the scatter! call.\n\nPreplot related\n\nheatarray = nothing : A keyword that plots a heatmap over the space. Its values can be standard data accessors given to functions like run!, i.e. either a symbol (directly obtain model property) or a function of the model. The returned data must be a matrix of the same size as the underlying space. For example heatarray = :temperature is used in the Daisyworld example. But you could also define f(model) = create_matrix_from_model... and set heatarray = f. The heatmap will be updated automatically during model evolution in videos and interactive applications.\nIt is strongly recommended to use abmplot instead of the abmplot! method if you use heatarray, so that a colorbar can be placed naturally.\nheatkwargs = NamedTuple() : Keywords given to Makie.heatmap function if heatarray is not nothing.\nadd_colorbar = true : Whether or not a Colorbar should be added to the right side of the heatmap if heatarray is not nothing.\nstatic_preplot! : A function f(ax, model) that plots something after the heatmap but before the agents. Notice that you can still make objects of this plot be visible above the agents using a translation in the third dimension like below:\nfunction static_preplot!(ax, model)\n    obj = scatter!(ax, [50 50]; color = :red) # Show position of teacher\n    hidedecorations!(ax) # hide tick labels etc.\n    translate!(obj, 0, 0, 5) # be sure that the teacher will be above students\nend\nosmkwargs = NamedTuple() : keywords directly passed to osmplot! from OSMMakie.jl if model space is OpenStreetMapSpace.\n\nThe stand-alone function abmplot also takes two optional NamedTuples named figure and axis which can be used to change the automatically created Figure and Axis objects.\n\nInteractivity\n\nEvolution related\n\nagent_step!, model_step! = Agents.dummystep: Stepping functions to pass to ABMObservable which itself passes to Agents.step!.\nadd_controls::Bool: If true, abmplot switches to \"interactive application\" mode. This is by default true if either agent_step! or model_step! keywords are provided. These stepping functions are used to evolve the model interactively using Agents.step!. The application has the following interactive elements:\n\"step\": advances the simulation once for spu steps.\n\"run\": starts/stops the continuous evolution of the model.\n\"reset model\": resets the model to its initial state from right after starting the interactive application.\nTwo sliders control the animation speed: \"spu\" decides how many model steps should be done before the plot is updated, and \"sleep\" the sleep() time between updates.\nenable_inspection = add_controls: If true, enables agent inspection on mouse hover.\nspu = 1:50: The values of the \"spu\" slider.\nparams = Dict() : This is a dictionary which decides which parameters of the model will be configurable from the interactive application. Each entry of params is a pair of Symbol to an AbstractVector, and provides a range of possible values for the parameter named after the given symbol (see example online). Changing a value in the parameter slides is only propagated to the actual model after a press of the \"update\" button.\n\nData collection related\n\nadata, mdata, when: Same as the keyword arguments of Agents.run!. If either or both adata, mdata are given, data are collected and stored in the abmobs, see ABMObservable. The same keywords provide the data plots of abmexploration. This also adds the button \"clear data\" which deletes previously collected agent and model data by emptying the underlying DataFrames adf/mdf. Reset model and clear data are independent processes.\n\nSee the documentation string of ABMObservable for custom interactive plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"agents_visualizations/#Interactive-ABM-Applications-1","page":"Plotting and Interactivity","title":"Interactive ABM Applications","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"agents_visualizations/#","page":"Plotting and Interactivity","title":"Plotting and Interactivity","text":"Continuing from the Daisyworld plots above, we can turn them into interactive applications straightforwardly, simply by providing the stepping functions as illustrated in the documentation of abmplot.

A user can provide an agent-stepping function, that acts on each agent one by one, and/or model-stepping function, that steps the entire model as a whole. These functions are standard Julia functions that take advantage of the Agents.jl API. Once these functions are created, they are simply passed to step! to evolve the model.\n[Optional] Visualize the model and animate its time evolution. This can help checking that the model behaves as expected and there aren't any mistakes, or can be used in making figures for a paper/presentation.\nCollect data. To do this, specify which data should be collected, by providing one standard Julia Vector of data-to-collect for agents, for example [:mood, :wealth], and another one for the model. The agent data names are given as the keyword adata and the model as keyword mdata to the function run!. This function outputs collected data in the form of a DataFrame.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/#","page":"Tutorial","title":"Tutorial","text":"If you're planning of running massive simulations, it might be worth having a look at the Performance Tips after familiarizing yourself with Agents.jl.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/#Space-1","page":"Tutorial","title":"1.

Return the data as two DataFrames, one for agent-level data and one for model-level data.\n\nData-deciding keywords\n\nadata::Vector means \"agent data to collect\". If an entry is a Symbol, e.g. :weight, then the data for this entry is agent's field weight. If an entry is a Function, e.g. f, then the data for this entry is just f(a) for each agent a. The resulting dataframe columns are named with the input symbol (here :weight, :f).\nadata::Vector{<:Tuple}: if adata is a vector of tuples instead, data aggregation is done over the agent properties.\nFor each 2-tuple, the first entry is the \"key\" (any entry like the ones mentioned above, e.g. :weight, f). The second entry is an aggregating function that aggregates the key, e.g. mean, maximum. So, continuing from the above example, we would have adata = [(:weight, mean), (f, maximum)].\nIt's also possible to provide a 3-tuple, with the third entry being a conditional function (returning a Bool), which assesses if each agent should be included in the aggregate. For example: x_pos(a) = a.pos[1]>5 with (:weight, mean, x_pos) will result in the average weight of agents conditional on their x-position being greater than 5.\nThe resulting data name columns use the function dataname. They create something like :mean_weight or :maximum_f_x_pos. In addition, you can use anonymous functions in a list comprehension to assign elements of an array into different columns: adata = [(a)->(a.interesting_array[i]) for i=1:N]. Column names can also be renamed with DataFrames.rename! after data is collected.\nNotice: Aggregating only works if there are agents to be aggregated over. If you remove agents during model run, you should modify the aggregating functions. E.g. instead of passing mean, pass mymean(a) = isempty(a) ? 0.0 : mean(a).\nmdata::Vector means \"model data to collect\" and works exactly like adata. For the model, no aggregation is possible (nothing to aggregate over).\nAlternatively, mdata can also be a function. This is a \"generator\" function, that accepts model as input and provides a Vector that represents mdata. Useful in combination with an ensemblerun! call that requires a generator function.\n\nBy default both keywords are nothing, i.e. nothing is collected/aggregated.\n\nMixed-Models\n\nFor mixed-models, the adata keyword has some additional options & properties. An additional column agent_type will be placed in the output dataframe.\n\nIn the case that data is needed for one agent type that does not exist in a second agent type, missing values will be added to the dataframe.\n\nWarning: Since this option is inherently type unstable, try to avoid this in a performance critical situation.\n\nAggregate functions will fail if missing values are not handled explicitly. If a1.weight but a2 (type: Agent2) has no weight, use a2(a) = a isa Agent2; adata = [(:weight, sum, a2)] to filter out the missing results.\n\nOther keywords\n\nwhen=true : at which steps s to perform the data collection and processing. A lot of flexibility is offered based on the type of when. If when::AbstractVector, then data are collected if s ∈ when. Otherwise data are collected if when(model, s) returns true. By default data are collected in every step.\nwhen_model = when : same as when but for model data.\nobtainer = identity : method to transfer collected data to the DataFrame. Typically only change this to copy if some data are mutable containers (e.g. Vector) which change during evolution, or deepcopy if some data are nested mutable containers. Both of these options have performance penalties.\nagents_first=true : Whether to update agents first and then the model, or vice versa.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"tutorial/#","page":"Tutorial","title":"Tutorial","text":"The run! function has been designed for maximum flexibility: nearly all scenarios of data collection are possible whether you need agent data, model data, aggregated data, or arbitrary combinations.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/#","page":"Tutorial","title":"Tutorial","text":"Nevertheless, we also expose a simple data-collection API (see Data collection), that gives users even more flexibility, allowing them to make their own \"data collection loops\" arbitrarily calling step! and collecting data as, and when, needed.","category":"page"},{"location":"tutorial/#","page":"Tutorial","title":"Tutorial","text":"As your models become more complex, it may not be advantageous to use lots of helper functions in the global scope to assist with data collection.
