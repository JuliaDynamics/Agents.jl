# This model follows the process known as diffusion-limited aggregation to simulate the growth of fractals.
# It is a kinetic process that consists of randomly diffusing particles giving rise to fractal-like structures
# resembling those observed naturally. This examplet is based off of
# ["Particularly Stuck" example](https://www.complexity-explorables.org/explorables/particularly-stuck/)
# in Complexity Explorables.

# The environment is a two dimensional, continuous space world. Agents are particles that diffuse and aggregate to form
# fractals. Initially, there are particles of random size distributed across the space, and one static particle in the center
# that forms the seed for the fractal growth. As moving particles collide with the seed or any particle that previously
# collided with the seed, it gets stuck and contributes to the fractal. As a particle gets stuck, another one is created at a
# circular border around the center to feed the growth.

# It is also available from the `Models` module as [`Models.fractal_growth`](@ref).

# We use the [`@agent`](@ref) macro to conveniently define a `Particle` agent. Each agent
# has a radius, representing the particle size, a boolean to define whether it is stuck and part of the fractal,
# and an axis around which it spins (elaborated on later). In addition, since we use the [`ContinuousAgent`](@ref)
# type, the [`@agent`](@ref) macro also provides each agent with fields for `id`, `pos` (its position in space) and
# `vel` (its velocity).

# We also define a few utility functions for ease of implementation.
# `rand_circle` returns a random point on the unit circle. `particle_radius`
# generates a random radius for a particle, within given range defined by `min_radius`
# and `max_radius`. If `max_radius < min_radius`, it returns `min_radius`: allowing
# a fixed particle size to be specified.

# attracts it towards the center, a tangential component that makes it orbit around the center,
# and a random component that simulates vibration of the particle. The velocity is scaled
# to be inversely proportional to the square of the particle's radius, so that larger particles
# move slower. The `speed` parameter is implemented as the time difference between successive
# steps of the simulation. A larger value causes particles to move more per step, but leads to
