# # Flock model
# ![](flock.gif)
#
# The flock model illustrates how flocking behavior can emerge when each bird follows three simple rules:
#
# * maintain a minimum distance from other birds to avoid collision
# * fly towards the average position of neighbors
# * fly in the average direction of neighbors

# It is also available from the `Models` module as [`Models.flocking`](@ref).

# ## Defining the core structures

# We begin by calling the required packages and defining an agent type representing a bird.

# The fields `id` and `pos` are required for every agent.
# The field `vel` is required for using [`move_agent!`](@ref) in `ContinuousSpace`.
# `speed` defines how far the bird travels in the direction defined by `vel` per `step`.
# `seperation` defines the minimum distance a bird must maintain from its neighbors.
# `visual_distance` refers to the distance a bird can see and defines a radius of neighboring birds.
# The contribution of each rule defined above recieves an importance weight: `cohere_factor`
# is the importance of maintaining the average position of neighbors,
# `match_factor` is the importance of matching the average trajectory of neighboring birds,
# and `separate_factor` is the importance of maining the minimum
# distance from neighboring birds.

# The great thing about [`plotabm`](@ref) is its flexibility. We can incorporate the
# direction of the birds when plotting them, by making the "marker" function `am`
# create a `Shape`: a triangle with same orientation as the bird's velocity.
# It is as simple as defining the following function:
function bird_triangle(b::Bird)
    φ = atan(b.vel[2], b.vel[1])
