# The flock model illustrates how flocking behavior can emerge when each bird follows three simple rules:
#
# * maintain a minimum distance from other birds to avoid collision
# * fly towards the average position of neighbors
# * fly in the average direction of neighbors

# It is also available from the `Models` module as [`Models.flocking`](@ref).

# ## Defining the core structures

# We begin by calling the required packages and defining an agent type representing a bird.

using Agents, LinearAlgebra
using Random # hide

@agent Bird ContinuousAgent{2} begin
    speed::Float64
    cohere_factor::Float64
    separation::Float64
    separate_factor::Float64
    match_factor::Float64
    visual_distance::Float64
end

# The fields `id` and `pos`, which are required for agents on [`ContinuousSpace`](@ref),
# are part of the struct. The field `vel`, which is also added by
# using [`ContinuousAgent`](@ref) is required for using [`move_agent!`](@ref)
# in `ContinuousSpace` with a time-stepping method.
# `speed` defines how far the bird travels in the direction defined by `vel` per `step`.
# `separation` defines the minimum distance a bird must maintain from its neighbors.
# `visual_distance` refers to the distance a bird can see and defines a radius of neighboring birds.
# The contribution of each rule defined above receives an importance weight: `cohere_factor`
# is the importance of maintaining the average position of neighbors,
# `match_factor` is the importance of matching the average trajectory of neighboring birds,
# and `separate_factor` is the importance of maintaining the minimum
# distance from neighboring birds.

# The function `initialize_model` generates birds and returns a model object using default values.

# The great thing about [`abmplot`](@ref) is its flexibility. We can incorporate the
# direction of the birds when plotting them, by making the "marker" function `am`
# create a `Polygon`: a triangle with same orientation as the bird's velocity.
# It is as simple as defining the following function:

const bird_polygon = Polygon(Point2f[(-0.5, -0.5), (1, 0), (-0.5, 0.5)])
function bird_marker(b::Bird)
    φ = atan(b.vel[2], b.vel[1]) #+ π/2 + π
    scale(rotate2D(bird_polygon, φ), 2)
end

# Where we have used the utility functions `scale` and `rotate2D` to act on a
# predefined polygon. We now give `bird_marker` to `abmplot`, and notice how
# the `as` keyword is meaningless when using polygons as markers.
