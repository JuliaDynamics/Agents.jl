"""
The second part of the Boltzmann Wealth Distribution example. 

In the first part of the Boltzmann example, the experiment is ran without
a spatial structure. In the second part, a spatial structure is added,
and agents are required to only give money to agents who are on the 
same node.

This example can be ran by navigating to the examples/ folder, starting 
a julia REPL session and running:

```
julia> include("boltzmann_wealth_distribution_with_grid.jl")
```

This will instantiate the model and create a `DataFrame` `data` that 
contains the result of running the model 10 steps. After running the
model, the results can be visualized in DataVoyager like this: 

```
julia> visualize_data(data);
```

...which should result in a pop-up window that displays graphs 
depicting the results of the experiment.
