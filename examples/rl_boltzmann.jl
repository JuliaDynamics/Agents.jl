# This example demonstrates how to integrate reinforcement learning (RL) with 
# agent-based modeling using the Boltzmann wealth distribution model. In this model,
# agents move around a grid and exchange wealth when they encounter other agents,
# but their movement decisions are learned through reinforcement learning rather
# than being random.

# The model showcases how RL agents can learn to optimize their behavior to achieve 
# specific goals - in this case, reducing wealth inequality as measured by the 
# Gini coefficient.

# ## Model specification

# The Boltzmann wealth model is a classic example in econophysics where agents 
# represent economic actors who exchange wealth. The traditional model uses random
# movement, but here we replace that with learned behavior using reinforcement learning.

# **Rules:**
# - Agents move on a 2D periodic grid
# - When agents occupy the same position, they may exchange wealth
# - Wealth flows from richer to poorer agents  
# - Agent movement is learned through RL to minimize wealth inequality

# **RL Integration:**
# - **Actions**: Stay, move North, South, East, or West (5 discrete actions)
# - **Observations**: Local neighborhood information and agent's relative wealth
# - **Reward**: Reduction in Gini coefficient (wealth inequality measure)
# - **Goal**: Learn movement patterns that promote wealth redistribution

# ## Loading packages and defining the agent type

@agent struct RLBoltzmannAgent(GridAgent{2})
    wealth::Int
end

# ## Utility functions

# First, we define the Gini coefficient calculation, which measures wealth inequality.
# A Gini coefficient of 0 represents perfect equality, while 1 represents maximum inequality.

function gini(wealths::Vector{Int})
    n, sum_wi = length(wealths), sum(wealths)
    (n <= 1 || sum_wi == 0.0) && return 0.0
    num = sum((2i - n - 1) * w for (i, w) in enumerate(sort(wealths)))
    den = n * sum_wi
    return num / den
end

# ## Agent stepping function

# The agent stepping function defines how agents behave in response to RL actions.
# Unlike traditional ABM where this might contain random movement, here the movement
# is determined by the RL policy based on the chosen action.

function boltzmann_rl_step!(agent::RLBoltzmannAgent, model, action::Int)
    ## Action definitions: 1=stay, 2=north, 3=south, 4=east, 5=west
    width, height = getfield(model, :space).extent
    dirs = ((0, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0))
    dx, dy = dirs[action]
    x, y = agent.pos
    target_pos = (mod1(x + dx, width), mod1(y + dy, height))

    move_agent!(agent, target_pos, model)

    ## Wealth exchange mechanism
    others = [a for a in agents_in_position(agent.pos, model) if a.id != agent.id]

    if !isempty(others)
        other = rand(others)
        ## Transfer wealth from richer to poorer agent
        if other.wealth > agent.wealth && other.wealth > 0
            agent.wealth += 1
            other.wealth -= 1
        end
    end
end

# ## RL-specific functions

# The following functions define how the RL environment interacts with the ABM:
# - **Observation function**: Extracts relevant state information for the RL agent
# - **Reward function**: Defines what behavior we want to encourage  
# - **Terminal function**: Determines when an episode ends

# ### Observation function

# The observation function provides agents with local neighborhood information.
# This includes occupancy information and relative wealth of nearby agents.

    grid_size = 2 * observation_radius + 1
    ## 2 channels: occupancy and relative wealth
    neighborhood_grid = zeros(Float32, grid_size, grid_size, 2)

    ## Get all agents in the neighborhood
    neighbor_ids = nearby_ids(target_agent, model, observation_radius)

    for neighbor in [model[id] for id in neighbor_ids]
        if neighbor.id == agent_id
            continue
        end

        ## Calculate relative position with periodic boundaries
        dx = neighbor.pos[1] - agent_pos[1]
        dy = neighbor.pos[2] - agent_pos[2]
        if abs(dx) > width / 2
            dx -= sign(dx) * width
        end
        if abs(dy) > height / 2
            dy -= sign(dy) * height
        end

        ## Convert to grid coordinates (center is at radius + 1)
        grid_x = dx + observation_radius + 1
        grid_y = dy + observation_radius + 1

        if 1 <= grid_x <= grid_size && 1 <= grid_y <= grid_size
            ## Channel 1: Occupancy
            neighborhood_grid[grid_x, grid_y, 1] = 1.0

            ## Channel 2: Normalized Relative Wealth
            wealth_diff = Float32(neighbor.wealth - target_agent.wealth)
            wealth_sum = Float32(neighbor.wealth + target_agent.wealth)
            if wealth_sum > 0
                neighborhood_grid[grid_x, grid_y, 2] = wealth_diff / wealth_sum
            end
        end
    end

    total_wealth = sum(a.wealth for a in allagents(model))
    normalized_wealth = total_wealth > 0 ? Float32(target_agent.wealth / total_wealth) : 0.0f0
    normalized_pos = (Float32(agent_pos[1] / width), Float32(agent_pos[2] / height))

    return (
        agent_id=agent_id,
        normalized_wealth=normalized_wealth,
        normalized_pos=normalized_pos,
        neighborhood_grid=neighborhood_grid
    )
end

## Define observation function that returns vectors directly
function boltzmann_get_observation(model::ABM, agent_id::Int)
    observation_data = get_local_observation_boltzmann(model, agent_id)

        flattened_grid
    )

# ### Reward function

# The reward function encourages agents to reduce wealth inequality by rewarding 
# decreases in the Gini coefficient. This creates an incentive for agents to learn
# movement patterns that promote wealth redistribution.

function boltzmann_calculate_reward(env, agent, action, initial_model, final_model)
    initial_wealths = [a.wealth for a in allagents(initial_model)]

    final_gini = gini(final_wealths)

    ## Reward decrease in Gini coefficient
    reward = (initial_gini - final_gini) * 100
    reward > 0 && (reward = reward / (abmtime(env) + 1))
    ## Small penalty for neutral actions
    reward <= 0.0 && (reward = -0.1f0)

    return reward
end

# ### Terminal condition

# Define when an RL episode should end. Here, episodes terminate when wealth
# inequality (Gini coefficient) drops below a threshold, indicating success.

function boltzmann_is_terminal_rl(env)
    wealths = [a.wealth for a in allagents(env)]

# ## Key takeaways

# This example demonstrates several important concepts:

# 1. **RL-ABM Integration**: How to seamlessly integrate reinforcement learning 
#    with agent-based modeling using the `ReinforcementLearningABM` type.

# 2. **Custom Reward Design**: The reward function encourages behavior that 
#    reduces wealth inequality, showing how RL can optimize for specific outcomes.

# 3. **Observation Engineering**: Agents observe their local neighborhood and 
#    relative wealth position, providing them with relevant information for decision-making.

# 4. **Policy Transfer**: Trained policies can be copied to fresh model instances,
#    enabling evaluation and deployment of learned behaviors.
