# The predator-prey model emulates the population dynamics of predator and prey animals who
# live in a common ecosystem and compete over limited resources. This model is an
# agent-based analog to the classic
# [Lotka-Volterra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations)
# differential equation model.

# This example illustrates how to develop models with
# heterogeneous agents (sometimes referred to as a *mixed agent based model*),
# incorporation of a spatial property in the dynamics (represented by a standard
# array, not an agent, as is done in most other ABM frameworks),
# and usage of [`GridSpace`](@ref), which allows multiple agents per grid coordinate.

# ## Model specification
# The environment is a two dimensional grid containing sheep, wolves and grass. In the
# model, wolves eat sheep and sheep eat grass. Their populations will oscillate over time
# if the correct balance of resources is achieved. Without this balance however, a
# population may become extinct. For example, if wolf population becomes too large,
# they will deplete the sheep and subsequently die of starvation.

# We will begin by loading the required packages and defining two subtypes of
# `AbstractAgent`: `Sheep`, `Wolf`. Grass will be a spatial property in the model.  All three agent types have `id` and `pos`
# properties, which is a requirement for all subtypes of `AbstractAgent` when they exist
# upon a `GridSpace`. Sheep and wolves have identical properties, but different behaviors
# as explained below. The property `energy` represents an animals current energy level.
# If the level drops below zero, the agent will die. Sheep and wolves reproduce asexually
# in this model, with a probability given by `reproduction_prob`. The property `Δenergy`
# controls how much energy is acquired after consuming a food source.

# Grass is a replenishing resource that occupies every position in the grid space. Grass can be
# consumed only if it is `fully_grown`. Once the grass has been consumed, it replenishes
# after a delay specified by the property `regrowth_time`. The property `countdown` tracks
# the delay between being consumed and the regrowth time.

# ## Making the model
# First we define the agent types
# (here you can see that it isn't really that much
# of an advantage to have two different agent types. Like in the [Rabbit, Fox, Wolf](@ref)
# example, we could have only one type and one additional field to separate them.
# Nevertheless, for the sake of example, we will use two different types.)
