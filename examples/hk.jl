# ## Model overview

# This is an implementation of a simple version of the
# [Hegselmann and Krause (2002)](http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/5/3/2.html) model.
# It is a model of opinion formation with the question: which
# parameters' values lead to consensus, polarization or fragmentation?
# It models interacting **groups** of agents (as opposed to interacting pairs, typical in
# the literature) in which it is assumed that if an agent disagrees too much with
# the opinion of a source of influence, the source can no longer influence the
# agent's opinion. There is then a "bound of confidence". The model shows that the
# systemic configuration is heavily dependent on this parameter's value.

# The model has the following components:

# - A set of n Agents with opinions xᵢ in the range [0,1] as attribute
# - A parameter ϵ called "bound" in (0, 0.3]
# - The update rule: at each step every agent adopts the mean of the opinions which are within
#   the confidence bound ( |xᵢ - xⱼ| ≤ ϵ).

# It is also available from the `Models` module as [`Models.hk`](@ref).

# ## Core structures
# We start by defining the Agent type and initializing the model.
# The Agent type has two fields so that we can implement the synchronous update.

using Statistics: mean

mutable struct HKAgent <: AbstractAgent
    id::Int
    old_opinion::Float64
    new_opinion::Float64
    previous_opinon::Float64
end

# There is a reason the agent has three fields that are "the same".
# The `old_opinion` is used for the synchronous agent update, since we require access
# to a property's value at the start of the step and the end of the step.
# The `previous_opinion` is the opinion of the agent in the _previous_ step,
# as the model termination requires access to a property's value
# at the end of the previous step, and the end of the current step.

# We could, alternatively, make the three opinions a single field with vector value.

# Add some helper functions for the update rule. As there is a filter in
# the rule we implement it outside the `agent_step!` method. Notice that the filter
# is applied to the `:old_opinion` field.

# Now we implement the `agent_step!`
function agent_step!(agent, model)
    agent.previous_opinon = agent.old_opinion
    agent.new_opinion = mean(boundfilter(agent, model))

# From this implementation we see that to implement synchronous scheduling
# we define an Agent type with `old` and `new` fields for attributes that
# are changed via the synchronous update. In `agent_step!` we use the `old` field
# then, after updating all the agents `new` fields, we use the `model_step!`
# to update the model for the next iteration.

# ## Running the model
# The parameter of interest is now `:new_opinion`, so we assign
# it to variable `adata` and pass it to the `run!` method
# to be collected in a DataFrame.

# In addition, we want to run the model only until all agents have converged to an opinion.
# From the documentation of [`step!`](@ref) one can see that instead of specifying the
# amount of steps we can specify a function instead.
