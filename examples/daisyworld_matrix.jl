# ## Overview of Daisyworld
#
# This model explores the [Gaia hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis),
# which considers the Earth as a single, self-regulating system including both living and
# non-living parts.
#
# Daisyworld is filled with black and white daisies.
# Their albedo's differ, with black daisies absorbing light and heat,
# warming the area around them; white daisies doing the opposite.
# Daisies can only reproduce within a certain temperature range, meaning too much
# (or too little) heat coming from the sun and/or surrounds will ultimately halt daisy
# propagation.
#
# When the climate is too cold it is necessary for the black daisies to propagate in order
# to raise the temperature, and vice versa -- when the climate is too warm, it is
# necessary for more white daisies to be produced in order to cool the temperature.
# The interplay of the living and non living aspects of this world manages to find an
# equilibrium over a wide range of parameter settings, although with enough external
# forcing, the daisies will not be able to self regulate the temperature of the planet
# and eventually go extinct.

# ## Defining the agent type

# The agent here is not so complex. We see it has three values (other than the required
# `id` and `pos` for an agent that lives on a [`GridSpace`](@ref). Each daisy has an `age`,
# confined later by a maximum age set by the user, a `breed` (either `:black` or `:white`)
# and an associated `albedo` value, again set by the user.

# ## Initialising Daisyworld

# Here, we construct a function to initialize a Daisyworld. We need to know how many
# daisies of each type to seed the planet with and what their albedo's are. The albedo
# of the planet, as well as how intense the world's star tends to be. Alternatively
# we can provide a `scenario` flag, which alters the stars luminosity in different
# ways.

# ## Model dynamics

# optimal temperature for growth. If the temperature gets too hot or too cold, daisies
# will not wish to propagate and may even die out. So long as the temperature is favorable,
# daisies compete for land and attempt to spawn a new plant of their `breed` in locations
# close to them.

# We observe an initial period of low solar luminosity which favors a large population of
# black daisies. The population however is kept in check by competition from white daisies
# and a semi-stable global temperature regime is reached, fluctuating between ~32 and 41
# degrees.
#
# An increase in solar luminosity forces a population inversion, then a struggle for
# survival for the black daisies -- which ultimately leads to their extinction. At
# extremely high solar output the white daisies dominate the landscape, leading to a
# uniform surface temperature.
#
# Finally, as the sun fades back to normal levels, both the temperature and white daisy
# population struggle to find equilibrium. The counterbalancing force of the black daisies
# being absent, Daisyworld is plunged into a chaotic regime -- indicating the strong role
# biodiversity has to play in stabilizing climate.
