# We'll simulate a zombie outbreak in a city. To do so, we start with an agent which
# satisfies the OSMSpace conditions of having a `pos`ition of type
# `Tuple{Int,Int,Float64}`, a `route` vector and a `destination` with the same type as
# `pos`. For simplicity though we shall build this with the [`@agent`](@ref) macro.

# around it. They have their own agenda and need to travel to some new destination.
# Unfortunately one of the population has turned and will begin infecting anyone who
# comes close.
