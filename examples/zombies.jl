# We'll simulate a zombie outbreak in a city. To do so, we start with an agent which
# satisfies the OSMSpace conditions of having a `pos`ition of type
# `Tuple{Int,Int,Float64}`. For simplicity though we shall build this with the [`@agent`](@ref)
# macro.

@agent Zombie OSMAgent begin
    infected::Bool
    speed::Float64
end

# To be explicit, this macro builds the following type:
# ```julia
# mutable struct Zombie <: AbstractAgent
#     id::Int
#     pos::Tuple{Int,Int,Float64}
#     infected::Bool
#     speed::Float64
# end
# ```
# where a tuple `(i, j, x)::Tuple{Int,Int,Float64}` means a position
# on the road between nodes `i, j` of the map, having progressed `x` distance along the road.

# The model constructor we build consists of a map, and 100 agents scattered randomly
# around it. They have their own agenda and need to travel to some new destination.
# Unfortunately one of the population has turned and will begin infecting anyone who
# comes close.
