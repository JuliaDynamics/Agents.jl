# # Schelling's segregation model

# In this introductory example we demonstrate Agents.jl's architecture and
# features through building
# the following definition of Schelling's segregation model:

# * Agents belong to one of two groups (0 or 1).
# * The agents live in a two-dimensional Moore grid (8 neighbors per node).
# * If an agent is in the same group with at least three neighbors, then it is happy.
# * If an agent is unhappy, it keeps moving to new locations until it is happy.

# Schelling's model shows that even small preferences of agents to have neighbors
# belonging to the same group (e.g. preferring that at least 30% of neighbors to
# be in the same group) could lead to total segregation of neighborhoods.

# ## Defining the agent type

using Agents

mutable struct SchellingAgent <: AbstractAgent
  id::Int # The identifier number of the agent
  pos::Tuple{Int,Int} # The x, y location of the agent on a 2D grid
  mood::Bool # whether the agent is happy in its node. (true = happy)
  group::Int # The group of the agent,  determines mood as it interacts with neighbors
end

# Notice that the position of this Agent type is a `Tuple{Int,Int}` because
# we will use a grid `Space`.

# We added two more fields for this model, namely a `mood` field which will
# store `true` for a happy agent and `false` for an unhappy one, and an `group`
# field which stores `0` or `1` representing two groups.

# ## Creating a space

# For this example, we will be using a Moore 2D grid, e.g.

space = Space((10,10), moore = true)

# ## Creating an ABM

# To make our model we follow the instructions of [`AgentBasedModel`](@ref).
# We also want to include a property `min_to_be_happy` in our model, and so we have:

properties = Dict(:min_to_be_happy => 3)
schelling = ABM(SchellingAgent, space;
                scheduler = fastest, properties = properties)


# Here we used the default scheduler (which is also the fastest one) to create
# the model. We could instead try to activate the agents according to their
# property `:group`, so that all agents of group 1 act first. We would then use the scheduler [`property_activation`](@ref) like so:

schelling2 = ABM(SchellingAgent, space; properties = properties,
                 scheduler = property_activation(:group))

# Notice that `partial_activation` accepts an argument and returns a function,
# which is why we didn't just give `partial_activation` to `scheduler`.

# ## Creating the ABM through a function

# Here we put the model instantiation in a function so that
# it will be easy to recreate the model and change its parameters.

# In addition, inside this function, we populate the model with some agents.
# We also change the scheduler to [`random_activation`](@ref).
# Because the function is defined based on keywords,
# it will be of further use in [`paramscan`](@ref) below.

function initialize(;numagents=320, griddims=(20, 20), min_to_be_happy=3)
    space = Space(griddims, moore = true)
    properties = Dict(:min_to_be_happy => 3)
    model = ABM(SchellingAgent, space; properties=properties, scheduler = random_activation)
    ## populate the model with agents, adding equal amount of the two types of agents
    ## at random positions in the model
    for n in 1:numagents
        agent = SchellingAgent(n, (1,1), false, n < numagents/2 ? 1 : 2)
        add_agent_single!(agent, model)
    end
    return model
end

# Notice that the position that an agent is initialized does not matter
# in this example.
# This is because it is set properly when adding an agent to the model.

# ## Defining a step function

# Finally, we define a _step_ function to determine what happens to an
# agent when activated.

function agent_step!(agent, model)
    agent.mood == true && return # do nothing if already happy
    minhappy = model.properties[:min_to_be_happy]
    neighbor_cells = node_neighbors(agent, model)
    count_neighbors_same_group = 0
    ## For each neighbor, get group and compare to current agent's group
    ## and increment count_neighbors_same_group as appropriately.
    for neighbor_cell in neighbor_cells
        node_contents = get_node_contents(neighbor_cell, model)
        ## Skip iteration if the node is empty.
        length(node_contents) == 0 && continue
        ## Otherwise, get the first agent in the node...
        agent_id = node_contents[1]
        ## ...and increment count_neighbors_same_group if the neighbor's group is
        ## the same.
        neighbor_agent_group = model.agents[agent_id].group
        if neighbor_agent_group == agent.group
            count_neighbors_same_group += 1
        end
    end
    ## After counting the neighbors, decide whether or not to move the agent.
    ## If count_neighbors_same_group is at least the min_to_be_happy, set the
    ## mood to true. Otherwise, move the agent to a random node.
    if count_neighbors_same_group â‰¥ minhappy
        agent.mood = true
    else
        move_agent_single!(agent, model)
    end
    return
end

# For the purpose of this implementation of Schelling's segregation model,
# we only need an agent step function.

# For defining `agent_step!` we used some of the built-in functions of Agents.jl,
# such as [`node_neighbors`](@ref) that returns the neighboring nodes of the
# node on which the agent resides, [`get_node_contents`](@ref) that returns the
# IDs of the agents on a given node, and [`move_agent_single!`](@ref) which moves
# agents to random empty nodes on the grid. A full list of built-in functions
# and their explanations are available in the [API](@ref) page.

# ## Running the model

# Let's initialize the model with 370 agents on a 20 by 20 grid.

model = initialize()

# We can run the model for one step
step!(model, agent_step!)     # run the model one step

# Or for three steps
step!(model, agent_step!, 3)  # run the model 3 steps.

# ## Running the model and collecting data

# We can use the same [`step!`](@ref) function with more arguments to run
# multiple steps and collect values of our desired fields from every agent
# and put these data in a `DataFrame` object.

model = initialize()

# We define an array of [`Symbols`](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/base/#Core.Symbol)
# for the agent fields that we want to collect as data
properties = [:pos, :mood, :group]

# And specify at which steps data should be collected.
n = 5  # number of time steps to run the simulation
when = 1:n  # At which steps to collect data

# Use the `step!` function to run the model and collect data into a DataFrame.
data = step!(model, agent_step!, n, properties, when=when)
data[1:10, :] # print only a few rows


# With the above `properties` vector, we collected all agents data.
# We can instead only collected aggregated data.
# For example, let's only get the number of happy individuals:

model = initialize(numagents=370, griddims=(20,20), min_to_be_happy=3);
properties = Dict(:mood => [sum])
n = 5; when = 1:n
data = step!(model, agent_step!, 5, properties, when=when)

# The other `Examples` pages are more realistic examples with a bit more meaningful
 # data processing steps.

# ## Visualizing the data

# We can use the `plot2D` function to plot the distribution of agents on a
# 2D grid at every generation, via the `AgentsPLots` package

p = plot2D(data, :group, t=1, nodesize=10)

p = plot2D(data, :group, t=2, nodesize=10)

# The first argument of the `plot2D` is the output data. The second argument is the
# column name in `data` that has the categories of each agent, which is `:group` in
# this case. `nodesize` determines the size of cells in the plot.

# Custom plots can be easily made with [`DataVoyager`](https://github.com/queryverse/DataVoyager.jl)
# because the outputs of simulations are always as a `DataFrame` object.

# ```julia
# using DataVoyager
# v = Voyager(data)
# ```

# ## Replicates and parallel computing

# We can run replicates of a simulation and collect all of them in a single `DataFrame`.
# To that end, we only need to specify `replicates` the `step!` function:

model = initialize(numagents=370, griddims=(20,20), min_to_be_happy=3);
data = step!(model, agent_step!, 5, properties, when=when, replicates=3)

# It is possible to run the replicates in parallel.
# For that, we should start julia with `julia -p n` where is the number
# of processing cores. Alternatively, we can define the number of cores from
# within a Julia session:

# ```julia
# using Distributed
# addprocs(4)
# ```

# For distributed computing to work, all definitions must be preceded with
# `@everywhere`, e.g.

# ```julia
# @everywhere using Agents
# @everywhere mutable struct SchellingAgent ...
# ```

# Then we can tell the `step!` function to run replicates in parallel:

# ```julia
# data = step!(model, agent_step!, 2, properties,
#              when=when, replicates=5, parallel=true)
# ```

# ## Scanning parameter ranges

# We often are interested in the effect of different parameters on the behavior of an
# agent-based model. `Agents.jl` provides the function [`paramscan`](@ref) to automatically explore
# the effect of different parameter values.

# We have already defined our model initialization function as `initialize`.
# We now also define a processing function, that returns the percentage of
# happy agents:

happyperc(moods) = count(x -> x == true, moods)/length(moods)

properties= Dict(:mood=>[happyperc])
parameters = Dict(:min_to_be_happy=>collect(2:5), :numagents=>[200,300], :griddims=>(20,20))

data = paramscan(parameters, initialize;
       properties=properties, n = 3, agent_step! = agent_step!)

# `paramscan` also allows running replicates per parameter setting:

data = paramscan(parameters, initialize; properties=properties, n = 3,
                 agent_step! = agent_step!, replicates=3)

data[end-10:end, :]

# We can combine all replicates with an aggregating function, such as mean, using
# the `aggregate` function from the `DataFrames` package:

using DataFrames: Not, select!
using Statistics: mean
data_mean = Agents.aggregate(data, [:step, :min_to_be_happy, :numagents],  mean);
select!(data_mean, Not(:replicate_mean))

# Note that the second argument takes the column names on which to split the data,
# i.e., it denotes which columns should not be aggregated. It should include
# the `:step` column and any parameter that changes among simulations. But it should
# not include the `:replicate` column.
# So in principle wha we are doing here is simply averaging our result across the replicates.
