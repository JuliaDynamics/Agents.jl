# ```

# This example illustrates how to integrate Agents.jl with
# [CellListMap.jl](https:://github.com/m3g/CellListMap.jl), to accelerate the
# computation of short-ranged (within a cutoff) interactions in 2D and 3D continuous
# spaces. CellListMap.jl is a package that allows the computation of pairwise interactions
# using an efficient and parallel implementation of [cell lists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_lists).

# ## The system simulated
#
# The example will illustrate how to simulate a set of particles in 2 dimensions, interacting
# through a simple repulsive potential of the form:
#
# $U(r) = k_i k_j\left[r^2 - (r_i+r_j)^2\right]^2~~~\textrm{for}~~~r \leq (r_i+r_j)$
#
# $U(r) = 0.0~~~\textrm{for}~~~r \gt (r_i+r_j)$
#
# where $r_i$ and $r_j$ are the radii of the two particles involved, and
# $k_i$ and $k_j$ are constants associated to each particle. The potential
# energy function is a smoothly decaying potential with a maximum when
# the particles overlap.
#
# Thus, if the maximum sum of radii between particles is much smaller than the size
# of the system, cell lists can greatly accelerate the computation of the pairwise forces.
#
# Each particle will have different radii and different repulsion force constants and masses.
using Agents

# Below we define the `Particle` type, which represents the agents of the
# simulation. The `Particle` type, for the `ContinuousAgent{2,Float64}` space, will have additionally
# an `id` and `pos` (position) and `vel` (velocity) fields, which are automatically added
# by the `@agent` macro.
@agent Particle ContinuousAgent{2,Float64} begin
    r::Float64 # radius
    k::Float64 # repulsion force constant
    mass::Float64
end
Particle(; id, pos, vel, r, k, mass) = Particle(id, pos, vel, r, k, mass)

# ## Required and data structures for CellListMap.jl
#
# We will use the high-level interface provided by the `PeriodicSystems` module
# (requires version ≥0.7.22):
using CellListMap.PeriodicSystems

# Two auxiliary arrays will be created on model initialization, to be passed to
# the `PeriodicSystem` data structure:
#
# 1. `positions`: `CellListMap` requires a vector of (preferentially) static vectors as the positions
#    of the particles. To avoid creating this array on every call, a buffer to
#    which the `agent.pos` positions will be copied is stored in this data structure.
# 2. `forces`: In this example, the property to be computed using `CellListMap.jl` is
#    the forces between particles, which are stored here in a `Vector{<:SVector}`, of
#    the same type as the positions. These forces will be updated by the `map_pairwise!`
#    function.
#
# Additionally, the computation with `CellListMap.jl` requires the definition of a `cutoff`,
# which will be twice the maximum interacting radii of the particles, and the geometry of the
# the system, given by the `unitcell` of the periodic box.
#
# More complex output data, variable system geometries and other options are supported,
# according to the [CellListMap.PeriodicSystems](https://m3g.github.io/CellListMap.jl/stable/PeriodicSystems/)
# user guide.
#
# ## Model initialization
# We create the model with a keyword-accepting function as is recommended in Agents.jl.
# The keywords here control number of particles and sizes.

# ## Computing the pairwise particle forces
# To follow the `CellListMap` interface, we first need a function that
# computes the force between a single pair of particles. This function
# receives the positions of the two particles (already considering
# the periodic boundary conditions), `x` and `y`, their indices in the
# array of positions, `i` and `j`, the squared distance between them, `d2`,
# the `forces` array to be updated and the `model` properties.
#
# Given these input parameters, the function obtains the properties of
# each particle from the model, and computes the force between the particles
# as (minus) the gradient of the potential energy function defined above.
#
# The function *must* return the `forces` array, to follow the `CellListMap` API.
#
function calc_forces!(x, y, i, j, d2, forces, model)

    pj = model[j]

        dr = y - x # x and y are minimum-image relative coordinates
        fij = 2 * (pi.k * pj.k) * (d2 - (pi.r + pj.r)^2) * (dr / d)
        forces[i] += fij
        forces[j] -= fij
    end
    return forces
end

# The `model_step!` function will use `CellListMap` to update the
# forces for all particles. The first argument of the call is
# the function to be computed for each pair of particles, which closes-over
# the `model` data to call the `calc_forces!` function defined above.
#

# ## Update agent positions and velocities
# The `agent_step!` function will update the particle positions and velocities,
# given the forces, which are computed in the `model_step!` function. A simple
# Euler step is used here for simplicity. Finally, the positions within the `CellListMap.PeriodicSystem`
# structure are updated.
