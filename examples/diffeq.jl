# # Integrating Agents.jl with DifferentialEquations.jl
#
# Leveraging other best-in-class packages from the Julia ecosystem is one of the many
# strengths Agents.jl provides over alternative ABMs.
#
# The [DifferentialEquations.jl](https://github.com/SciML/DifferentialEquations.jl) package
# is one excellent example.
# Here, we provide a few ways of leveraging `DifferentialEquations` to solve agent based
# models in an efficient and performant manner, whilst mitigating stability issues one
# may encounter.
#
# It is common in discrete time step tools (such as `Agents`) to also discretise equations
# required for obtaining solutions. In the following example, we use the
# [forward Euler method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method)
# to discretise a logistic function
#
# ``\frac{\mathrm{d}s}{\mathrm{d}t} = s \left(1-\frac{s}{120}\right) - h``
#
# into
#
# ``s_{t+1} = s_t + s_t (1-s_t/120)-h.``
#
# In this example, ``s`` denotes some fish **s**tock that increases over time until a maximum
# population (e.g. 120 here) is met, with the additional property that a **h**arvest (``h``)
# may also remove some population (we also assume a timestep of 1 normalised unit to
# simplify things).
#
# ## Problem setup
#
# Let's build a fishing community with fishers, each with differing methods and experience,
# culminating in a variety of competence when it comes to actually catching fish.

# These methods should be quite straightforward: each step of the model (`agent_step!`),
# every agent will catch some fish based on their competency.
# There are some safeguards in place to not allow fishers to totally deplete the stock, thus
# `dstock` checks the total yearly catch and only harvests if the population is above a
# minimal threshold (in a more complete example, one should set a flag to state that this
# year's catch exceeded the limit and regulate fishing next year, but we'll ignore this
# complexity for this example).
#
# Building this model is simple. Set some initial conditions for the stock, and add agents
# with some competence.

# ### Add in some bureaucracy
#
# OK, so let's add in some annoyances for the fishers.
# Of course, they wish to go out and catch regularly, but regulators only want to do their
# job once a year!
# Since it's the regulators who will monitor the total stock condition and advise fishers
# as to whether or not they can continue fishing, a systematic blind spot is
# inadvertently introduced into the system. Yearly catch and regulation occur on one day a
# year, whilst the stock will of course grow on a daily basis.
#
# To achieve this, we extend the model like so:

# So this is fairly quick since the model is a simple one, but it's certainly not as efficient
# as it could be.
# We calculate the stock value every single day, since the forward Eulerian method requires us
# to, so it can evolve correctly.
# In addition to this, Eulerian expansion introduces uncertainty into our results, which is tied
# to the choice of step size.
# For accurate results, one should never really use this approximate method - although it is
# almost ubiquitous throughout contemporary research code.
