# # SIR model for the spread of COVID-19
# ![](covid_evolution.gif)
#
# This example illustrates how to use `GraphSpace` and how to model agents on an graph
# (network) where the transition probabilities between each node (position) is not constant.
# ## SIR model

# A SIR model tracks the ratio of Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered individuals within a population.
# Here we add one more category of individuals: those who are infected, but do not know it.
# Transmission rate for infected and diagnosed individuals is lower than infected and undetected.
# We also allow a fraction of recovered individuals to catch the disease again, meaning
# that recovering the disease does not bring full immunity.

# ## Model parameters
# Here are the model parameters, some of which have default values.
# * `Ns`: a vector of population sizes per city. The amount of cities is just `C=length(Ns)`.
# * `β_und`: a vector for transmission probabilities β of the infected but undetected per city.
#   Transmission probability is how many susceptible are infected per day by an infected individual.
#   If social distancing is practiced, this number increases.
# * `β_det`: an array for transmission probabilities β of the infected and detected per city.
#   If hospitals are full, this number increases.
# * `infection_period = 30`: how many days before a person dies or recovers.
# * `detection_time = 14`: how many days before an infected person is detected.
# * `death_rate = 0.02`: the probability that the individual will die after the `infection_period`.
# * `reinfection_probability = 0.05`: The probability that a recovered person can get infected again.
# * `migration_rates`: A matrix of migration probability per individual per day from one city to another.
# * `Is = [zeros(C-1)..., 1]`: An array for initial number of infected but undetected people per city.
#   This starts as only one infected individual in the last city.

# Notice that `Ns, β, Is` all need to have the same length, as they are numbers for each
# city. We've tried to add values to the infection parameters similar to the ones you would hear
# on the news about COVID-19.

# The good thing with Agent based models is that you could easily extend the model we
# implement here to also include age as an additional property of each agent.
# This makes ABMs flexible and suitable for research of virus spreading.

# ## Making the model in Agents.jl
# We start by defining the `PoorSoul` agent type and the ABM
