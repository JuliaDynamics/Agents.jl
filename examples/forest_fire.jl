# The forest fire model is defined as a cellular automaton on a grid.
# A position can be empty or occupied by a tree which is ok, burning or burnt.
# We implement a slightly different ruleset to that of
# [Drossel and Schwabl (1992)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest-fire_model),
# so that our implementation can be compared with other ABM frameworks
#
# 1. A burning position turns into a burnt position
# 1. A tree will burn if at least one neighbor is burning

# The forest has an innate `density`, which is the proportion of trees initialized as
# `green`, however all trees that reside at `x=1` on the grid are `burning`.
# The model is also available from the `Models` module as [`Models.forest_fire`](@ref).

# ## Defining the core structures

# We start by defining the agent type
using Agents, Random
using InteractiveDynamics
using CairoMakie
CairoMakie.activate!() # hide

mutable struct Tree <: AbstractAgent
    id::Int
    pos::Dims{2}
    status::Symbol  #:green, :burning, :burnt
end
nothing # hide

# The agent type `Tree` has three fields: `id` and `pos`, which have to be there for any agent,
# and a `status` field that we introduce for this specific model.
# The `status` field will be `:green` when the tree is ok, `:burning` when on fire,
# and finally `:burnt`.

# We then make a setup function that initializes the model.

# Because of the way the forest fire model is defined, we only need a
# stepping function for the agents

# Now we can do some data collection as well using an aggregate function `percentage`:

# dark red for burnt.
