# # Forest fire model

# ![](forest.gif)

# The forest fire model is defined as a cellular automaton on a grid.
# A cell can be empty, occupied by a tree, or burning.
# The model of [Drossel and Schwabl (1992)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest-fire_model)
# is defined by four rules which are executed simultaneously:
#
# 1. A burning cell turns into an empty cell
# 1. A tree will burn if at least one neighbor is burning
# 1. A tree ignites with probability `f` even if no neighbor is burning
# 1. An empty space fills with a tree with probability `p`

# The forest has an innate density `d`, which is the proportion of trees initialized as
# green.
# This model is an example that does _not_ have an `agent_step!` function. It only
# uses a `model_step!`.
# It is also available from the `Models` module as [`Models.forest_fire`](@ref).

# ## Defining the core structures

# We start by defining the agent type
using Agents, Random, AgentsPlots
pyplot() # hide

mutable struct Tree <: AbstractAgent
    id::Int
    pos::Tuple{Int,Int}
    status::Bool  # true is green and false is burning
end
nothing # hide

# The agent type `Tree` has three fields: `id` and `pos`, which have to be there for any agent,
# and a `status` field that we introduce for this specific model.
# The `status` field will hold `true` for a green tree and `false` for a burning one.
# All other model parameters go into the `AgentBasedModel`.

# We then make a setup function that initializes the model.
