# The forest fire model is defined as a cellular automaton on a grid.
# A position can be empty or occupied by a tree which is ok, burning or burnt.
# We implement a slightly different ruleset to that of
# [Drossel and Schwabl (1992)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest-fire_model),
# so that our implementation can be compared with other ABM frameworks
#
# 1. A burning position turns into a burnt position
# 1. A tree will burn if at least one neighbor is burning

# The forest has an innate `density`, which is the proportion of trees initialized as
# `green`, however all trees that reside on the left side of the grid are `burning`.
# The model is also available from the `Models` module as [`Models.forest_fire`](@ref).

# ## Defining the core structures

# Cellular automata don't necessarily require an agent-like structure. Here we will
# demonstrate how a model focused solution is possible.
