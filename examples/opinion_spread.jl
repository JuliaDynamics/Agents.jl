# This is a simple model of how an opinion spreads through a community.
# Each individual has a number of opinions as a list of integers.
# They can change their opinion by changing the numbers in the list.

# Agents can change their opinion at each step.
# They choose one of their neighbors randomly, and adopt one of the neighbor's opinion.
# They are more likely to adopt their neighbors opinion if the share more opinions with each other.

# ## Building the model
# ### 1. Model creation

    id::Int
    pos::Dims{2}
    stabilized::Bool
    opinion::Array{Int,1}
    prev_opinion::Array{Int,1}
end

function create_model(; dims = (10, 10), nopinions = 3, levels_per_opinion = 4)
    space = GridSpace(dims)
    properties = Dict(:nopinions => nopinions)
    model = AgentBasedModel(
        Citizen,
        space,
        scheduler = random_activation,
        properties = properties,
    )

            pos,
            model,
            false,
            rand(model.rng, 1:levels_per_opinion, nopinions),
            rand(model.rng, 1:levels_per_opinion, nopinions),
        )
    end
    return model
end

# ### 2. Stepping functions

function adopt!(agent, model)
    neighbor = rand(model.rng, collect(nearby_ids(agent, model)))
    matches = model[neighbor].opinion .== agent.opinion
    nmatches = count(matches)
    if nmatches < model.nopinions && rand(model.rng) < nmatches / model.nopinions
        switchId = rand(model.rng, findall(x -> x == false, matches))
        agent.opinion[switchId] = model[neighbor].opinion[switchId]

        agent.prev_opinion[i] = agent.opinion[i]

# ## Running the model

# First, we create a stopping condition, which runs the model until all agents stabilize.

rununtil(model, s) = count(a -> a.stabilized, allagents(model)) == length(positions(model))

# Then we create our model, run it and collect some information

model = create_model(nopinions = 3, levels_per_opinion = 4)

agentdata, _ = run!(model, agent_step!, dummystep, rununtil, adata = [(:stabilized, count)])

# ## Plotting

# The plot shows the number of stable agents, that is, number of agents whose opinions
# don't change from one step to the next. Note that the number of stable agents can
# fluctuate before the final convergence.
