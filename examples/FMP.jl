# # Force Based Motion Planning
# ![](circle_swap_pretty.gif) 

# This is an example implementation of the [Force Based Motion Planning (FMP)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05415.pdf) algorithm. The algorithm is a decentralized motion
# planning algorithm where individual agents experience attractive forces towards
# a goal position and repulsive forces from other agents or objects in the environment. 
# ## Defining the Agent

# First we need to define an `AbstractAgent` struct that has the necessary
# information for the FMP algorithm to run. `pos`, and `vel` are position and
# velocity, respectively. `tau` is an agents goal position. `color` is an
# optional parameter for plotting used in this example. `type` is the agent
# type: `:A` is an agent, `:O` is an obstacle, and `:T` is a target. `radius`
# is the radius of the agent. `SSdims` is an optional parameter used for
# plotting purposes.
#
# Agent types have the following distinctions:
# - :A = agent (has velocity, subject to repulsive forces)
# - :O = object (has no velocity, cannot move, agents must go around)
# - :T = target (no velocity, just a projection of agent target zone)

    type::Symbol
    radius::Float64
    SSdims::NTuple{2, Float64}  ## include this for plotting
    Ni::Array{Int64} ## array of tuples with agent ids and agent positions
    Gi::Vector{Int64} ## array of neighboring goal IDs
end

# ## Defining the Model

# Next, we define the model. The FMP algorithm has several parameters defined
# in the original paper which are stored in a struct. Typical values can be
# generated using the `fmp_parameter_init` function and loaded into the model
# properties. 

## define AgentBasedModel (ABM)

function FMP_Model()
    properties = Dict(:FMP_params=>fmp_parameter_init(),
                      :dt => 0.01,
                      :num_agents=>30,

    space2d = ContinuousSpace((1,1); periodic = true)
    model = ABM(FMP_Agent, space2d, properties=properties)
    return model
end

# ## Adding Agents to the Model

# Now that we have defined a model, lets add some agents into it. In the
# following example, we add agents around the perimeter of a circle. We add
# their target position (tau) across the circle from each agent. Note that the
# arguments passed to `add_agent!` correspond to the `AbstractAgent` struct
# we defined earlier. Note that `:A` (agent types) experience navigational
# forces and repulsive forces. `:T` (target types) do not experience any
# forces.

# Also note that the `color` parameter doesn't do anything unless we use some
# plotting functionalities (described later in this tutorial)

## add agents to model
model = FMP_Model()

# lets start by defining a helper function that takes a model and some
# placement functions to place agents

function agent_placement_helper!(model, agent_placer, goal_placer, color_select)
    x, y = model.space.extent

    for i in 1:model.num_agents

        pos = agent_placer(x, y, i, model.num_agents)
        tau = goal_placer(x, y, i, model.num_agents)

        vel = (0,0)
        radius = model.FMP_params.d/2

        if color_select != "none"
            color = color_select(i, model.num_agents)
        else
            color = "none"
        end

        if agent_placer != "none"
            add_agent!(pos, model, vel, tau, color, :A, radius, model.space.extent, [], [])
        end

        if goal_placer != "none"
            add_agent!(tau, model, vel, tau, color, :T, radius, model.space.extent, [], [])
        end
    end
end

# place agents around circle, place targets opposite of agents
circle_agents(x, y, i, num_agents) = (0.45*cos((2*π/num_agents)*i)+x/2, 
                                     0.45*sin((2*π/num_agents)*i)+y/2

# ## Running a Simulation

# Now that we've defined our agent type, our model, and added agents into the
# model, we are ready to simulate. First we define a method for `agent_step!`.
# Note that `agent_step!` takes into account our `update_vel` function during
# simulation at each time step.

# Note the inclusion of the call to `FMP_Update_Interacting_Pairs` and
# `FMP_Update_Interacting_Pairs` in the `model_step!` function.. This
# function occurrs once during each model time step and calls the
# [`interacting_pairs`](@ref) function to see if agents are within an
# interactive radius of one another. If they are, they the FMP algorithm
# computes their attractive/repulsive forces. 

agent_step!(agent, model) = move_agent!(agent, model, model.dt)
