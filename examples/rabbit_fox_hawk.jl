# This model is a variation on the [Predator-prey dynamics](@ref) example. It uses a 3-dimensional
# [`ContinuousSpace`](@ref), a realistic terrain for the agents, and pathfinding (with multiple
# pathfinders).
#
# Agents in this model are one of three species of animals: rabbits, foxes and hawks. Rabbits
# eat grass, and are hunted by foxes and hawks. While rabbits and foxes are restricted to
# walk on suitable portions of the map, hawks are capable of flight and can fly over a much
# larger region of the map.
#
# Similar to the [Predator-prey dynamics](@ref) example, agent types are distinguished using a
# `type` field. Agents also have an additional `energy` field, which is consumed to move around
# and reproduce. Eating food (grass or rabbits) replenishes `energy` by a fixed amount.

# The environment is generated from a heightmap: a 2D matrix, where each value denotes the
# height of the terrain at that point. We segregate the model into 4 regions based on the
# height:
# - Anything below `water_level` is waster and cannot be walked on
# - The region between `water_level` and `grass_level` is flatland, that can be walked on
# - The part of the map between `grass_level` and `mountain_level` is too high for animals to
#   walk over, but it can be flown over
# - The terrain above `mountain_level` is completely inaccessible
#
# Grass is the food source for rabbits. It can grow anywhere from `water_level` to `grass_level`.
# The spread of grass across the terrain is specified using a BitArray. A value of
# 1 at a location indicates the presence of grass there, which can be consumed when it is eaten
# by a rabbit. The probability of grass growing is proportional to how close it is to the water.
#
# The `initialize_model` function takes in the URL to our heightmap, the thresholds for the 4
# regions, and some additional parameters for the model. It then creates and returns a model
# with the specified heightmap and containing the specified number of rabbits, foxes and hawks.
