# ## Overview of Daisyworld
#
# This model explores the [Gaia hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypothesis),
# which considers the Earth as a single, self-regulating system including both living and
# non-living parts.
#
# Daisyworld is filled with black and white daisies.
# Their albedo's differ, with black daisies absorbing light and heat,
# warming the area around them; white daisies doing the opposite.
# Daisies can only reproduce within a certain temperature range, meaning too much
# (or too little) heat coming from the sun and/or surrounds will ultimately halt daisy
# propagation.
#
# When the climate is too cold it is necessary for the black daisies to propagate in order
# to raise the temperature, and vice versa -- when the climate is too warm, it is
# necessary for more white daisies to be produced in order to cool the temperature.
# The interplay of the living and non living aspects of this world manages to find an
# equilibrium over a wide range of parameter settings, although with enough external
# forcing, the daisies will not be able to regulate the temperature of the planet
# and eventually go extinct.

# ## Defining the agent types

# `Daisy` has three values (other than the required
# `id` and `pos` for an agent that lives on a [`GridSpace`](@ref). Each daisy has an `age`,
# confined later by a maximum age set by the user, a `breed` (either `:black` or `:white`)
# and an associated `albedo` value, again set by the user.
# `Land` represents the surface. We could make `Land` also have an albedo field, but
# in this world, the entire surface has the same albedo and thus we make it a model parameter.

# Notice that the `Land` does not necessarily have to be an agent, and one could represent
# surface temperature via a matrix (parameter of the model). This is done in an older version,
# see file `examples/daisyworld_matrix.jl`. The old version has a slight performance advantage.
# However, the advantage of making the surface composed of
# agents is that visualization is simple and one can use the interactive application to also
# visualize surface temperature.
# It is also available from the `Models` module as [`Models.daisyworld`](@ref).

# ## Interactive scientific research
# Julia is an interactive language, and thus everything that you do with Agents.jl can be
# considered interactive. However, we can do even better by using our interactive application.
# In this example, rather than describing what solar forcing we want to investigate before
# hand, we use the interactive application, to control by ourselves, in real time, how
# much solar forcing is delivered to daisyworld.

# So, let's use `interactive_abm` from the [Interactive application](@ref) page!

# ```julia
# using InteractiveChaos, Makie, Random
# Random.seed!(165)
# model = daisyworld(; solar_luminosity = 1.0, solar_change = 0.0, scenario = :change)
# ```

# Thankfully, we have already defined the necessary `adata, mdata` as well as the agent
# color/shape/size functions, and we can re-use them for the interactive application.
# Because `InteractiveChaos` uses a different plotting package, Makie.jl, the plotting
# functions we have defined for `plotabm` need to be slightly adjusted.
# In the near future, AgentsPlots.jl will move to Makie.jl, so no adjustment will be necessary.

# ```julia
# using AbstractPlotting: to_color
# daisycolor(a::Daisy) = RGBAf0(to_color(a.breed))
# const landcolor = cgrad(:thermal)
# daisycolor(a::Land) = to_color(landcolor[(a.temperature+50)/150])
#
# daisyshape(a::Daisy) = :circle
# daisysize(a::Daisy) = 0.6
# daisyshape(a::Land) = :rect
# daisysize(a::Land) = 1
# ```

# The only significant addition to use the interactive application is that we make a parameter
# container for surface albedo and for the rate of change of solar luminosity, and add some labels for clarity.

# ```julia
# params = Dict(
#     :solar_change => -0.1:0.01:0.1,
#     :surface_albedo => 0:0.01:1,
# )
#
# alabels = ["black", "white", "T"]
# mlabels = ["L"]
#
# landfirst = by_type((Land, Daisy), false)
#
# scene, agent_df, model_def = interactive_abm(
#     model, agent_step!, model_step!, params;
#     ac = daisycolor, am = daisyshape, as = daisysize,
#     mdata = mdata, adata = adata, alabels = alabels, mlabels = mlabels,
#     scheduler = landfirst # crucial to change model scheduler!
# )
# ```
