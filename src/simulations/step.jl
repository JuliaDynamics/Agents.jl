"""
    step!(model::ABM)

Perform one simulation step for the `model`.
For continuous time models, this means to run to the model
up to the next event and perform that.

    step!(model::ABM, t::Real)

Step the model forwards until there is a temporal difference `â‰¥ t`
from the current model time. I.e., step the model forwards for at least `t` time.
For discrete time models like [`StandardABM`](@ref) `t` must be integer
and evolves the model for _exactly_ `t` steps.

    step!(model::ABM, f::Function)

Step the model forwards until `f(model, t)` returns `true`,
where `t` is the current amount of time the model has been evolved
for, starting from the model's initial time.

See also [Advanced stepping](@ref).
