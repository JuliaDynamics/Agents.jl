"""
    sample!(model::ABM, n [, weight]; kwargs...)

Replace the agents of the `model` with a random sample of the current agents with
size `n`.

Optionally, provide a `weight`: Symbol (agent field) or function (input agent
out put number) to weight the sampling.
This means that the higher the `weight` of the agent, the higher the probability that
this agent will be chosen in the new sampling.

# Keywords
* `replace = true` : whether sampling is performed with replacement, i.e. all agents can
be chosen more than once.
* `rng = GLOBAL_RNG` : a random number generator to perform the sampling with.

See the Wright-Fisher example in the documentation for an application of `sample!`.
