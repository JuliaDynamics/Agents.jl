"""
    sample!(model::ABM, n [, weight]; kwargs...)

Replace the agents of the `model` with a random sample of the current agents with
size `n`.

Optionally, provide a `weight`: Symbol (agent field) or function (input agent
out put number) to weight the sampling.
This means that the higher the `weight` of the agent, the higher the probability that
this agent will be chosen in the new sampling.

# Keywords
* `replace = true` : whether sampling is performed with replacement, i.e. all agents can
be chosen more than once.

Example usage in [Wright-Fisher model of evolution](https://juliadynamics.github.io/AgentsExampleZoo.jl/dev/examples/wright-fisher/).

"""
    replicate!(agent, model; kwargs...) 

Create a new agent at the same position of the given agent, copying the values
of its fields. With the `kwargs` it is possible to override the values by specifying
new ones for some fields. 
Return the new agent instance.

## Example
```julia
using Agents
@agent A GridAgent{2} begin
    k::Float64
    w::Float64
end

model = ABM(A, GridSpace((5, 5)))
a = A(1, (2, 2), 0.5, 0.5)
b = replicate!(a, model; w = 0.8)
