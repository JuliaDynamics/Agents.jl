All agents must be a mutable subtype of `AbstractAgent`.
Your agent type **must have** at least the `id` field, and if there is a
space structure the `pos` field, (fields are expected in this order)
```julia
mutable struct MyAgent{P} <: AbstractAgent
    id::Int
    pos::P
end
```
Only for grid spaces, `pos` can be an `NTuple`. For arbitrary graph spaces
it must always be an integer (the graph node number).

Your agent type may have other additional fields relevant to your system,
for example variable quantities like "status" or other "counters".

    AgentBasedModel(agent_type [, space]; scheduler, properties)
Create an agent based model from the given agent type,
and the `space` (from [`Space`](@ref)).
`ABM` is equivalent with `AgentBasedModel`.
The agents are stored in a dictionary `model.agents`, where the keys are the
agent IDs, while the values are the agents themselves.
It is recommended however to use [`id2agent`](@ref) to get an agent.

`space` can be omitted, in which it will equal to `nothing`.
This means that all agents are virtualy in one node and have no spatial structure.
If space is omitted, some functions that fascilitate agent-space interactions will not work.

Optionally provide a `scheduler` that creates the order with which agents
are activated in the model, and `properties`
for additional model-level properties.
This is accessed as `model.properties` for later use.
