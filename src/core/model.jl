All agents must be a mutable subtype of `AbstractAgent`.
Your agent type **must have** the `id` field as first field.
Depending on the space structure there might be a `pos` field of appropriate type
and a `vel` field of appropriate type.

Your agent type may have other additional fields relevant to your system,
for example variable quantities like "status" or other "counters".

## Examples
Imagine agents who have extra properties `weight, happy`. For a [`GraphSpace`](@ref)
we would define them like
```julia
mutable struct ExampleAgent <: AbstractAgent
    id::Int
    pos::Int
    weight::Float64
    happy::Bool
end
```
while for e.g. a [`ContinuousSpace`](@ref) we would use
```julia
mutable struct ExampleAgent{D} <: AbstractAgent
    id::Int
    pos::NTuple{D, Float64}
    vel::NTuple{D, Float64}
    weight::Float64
    happy::Bool
end
```

    AgentBasedModel(agent_type [, space]; scheduler, properties)
Create an agent based model from the given agent type,
and the `space` (from [Space](@ref Space)).
`ABM` is equivalent with `AgentBasedModel`.
The agents are stored in a dictionary `model.agents`, where the keys are the
agent IDs, while the values are the agents themselves.
It is recommended however to use [`id2agent`](@ref) to get an agent.

`space` can be omitted, in which it will equal to `nothing`.
This means that all agents are virtualy in one node and have no spatial structure.
If space is omitted, some functions that fascilitate agent-space interactions will not work.

Optionally provide a `scheduler` that creates the order with which agents
are activated in the model, and `properties`
for additional model-level properties.
This is accessed as `model.properties` for later use.
