Distance is approximated as the shortest path between the two points, provided the

Optionally provide a `Vector{Int}` that represents the cost of going from a tile to the
neighboring tile on the `i` dimensional diagonal (default is `10√i`).

If `diagonal_movement=false` in [`Pathfinding.AStar`](@ref), neighbors in diagonal
positions will be excluded. Cost defaults to the first value of the provided vector.

    Pathfinding.PenaltyMap(pmap::Array{Int,D} [, base_metric::CostMetric]) <: CostMetric{D}
Distance between two positions is the sum of the shortest distance between them and the
absolute difference in penalty.

A penalty map (`pmap`) is required. For pathfinding in [`GridSpace`](@ref), this should be the
same dimensions as the space. For pathfinding in [`ContinuousSpace`](@ref), the size of this map
determines the granularity of the underlying grid, and should agree with the size of the
`walkable` map.

Distance is calculated using [`Pathfinding.DirectDistance`](@ref) by default, and can be
changed by specifying `base_metric`.

An example usage can be found in [Mountain Runners](@ref).
