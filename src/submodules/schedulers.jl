"""
    Schedulers
Submodule containing all predefined schedulers of Agents.jl and the scheduling API.
Schedulers have a very simple interface. They are functions that take as an input the ABM and
return an iterator over agent IDs. Notice that this iterator can be a "true" iterator
(non-allocated) or can be just a standard vector of IDs. You can define your own scheduler
according to this API and use it when making an [`AgentBasedModel`](@ref).
You can also use the function `schedule(model)` to obtain the scheduled ID list,
if you prefer to write your own `step!`-like loop.

See also [Advanced scheduling](@ref) for making more advanced schedulers.

Notice that schedulers can be given directly to model creation, and thus become the
"default" scheduler a model uses, but they can just as easily be incorporated in a
`model_step!` function as shown in [Advanced stepping](@ref).

Otherwise returns agents grouped in order of appearance in the `Union`.
- `shuffle_agents = true` randomizes the order of agents within each group, `false` returns
the default order of the container (equivalent to [`Schedulers.fastest`](@ref)).
