Update message: Agents v$(version_number)
Welcome to this new update of Agents.jl!
Noteworthy changes:

- The `@agent` macro has been re-written and is now more general and more safe.
  It now also allows inheriting fields from any other type.
- The `@agent` macro is now THE way to create agent types for Agents.jl simulations.
  Directly creating structs by hand is no longer mentioned in the documentation at all.
  This will allow us in the future to utilize additional fields that the user does not
  have to know about, which may bring new features or performance gains by being
  part of the agent structures.
- The minimal agent types like `GraphAgent` can be used normally as standard agent
  types that only have the mandatory fields. This is now clear in the docs.
  (this was possible also before v5.4, just not clear)
- In the future, making agent types by hand may be completely disallowed, resulting
  in error. Therefore, making agent types manually is considered deprecated.
- New function `normalize_position`.

See the CHANGELOG.md, because v5.4 was also a large release!
