Update message: Agents v$(version_number)
Welcome to this new update of Agents.jl!

Breaking changes:

- Agents.jl moved to Julia 1.9+, and now exports visualization
  and interactive applications automatically once Makie (or Makie backends
  such as GLMakie) come into scope, using the new package extension system.
  The only downside of this is that now to visualize ABMs on open street
  maps, the package OSMMakie.jl must be explicitly loaded as well.
  InteractiveDynamics.jl is now obsolete.
- We have created an objective fully automated framework for comparing open source
  agent based modelling software. It shows that Agents.jl is much faster
  than competing alternatives (MASON, NetLogo, Mesa).
- The `@agent` macro is now THE way to create agent types for Agents.jl simulations since
  now supports declaring default and constant fields. Directly creating structs by hand is
  no longer mentioned in the documentation at all. This will allow us in the future to utilize
  additional fields that the user does not have to know about, which may bring new features or
  performance gains by being part of the agent structures. The macro has been rewritten to make it
  possible to declare fields as constants. The old version still works but it's deprecated.
  Refer to the documentation of the macro for the new syntax.
- Manually setting or altering the ids of agents is no longer allowed. The agent id is now considered
  a read-only field, and is set internally by Agents.jl to enable hidden optimizations in the future.
  As a consequence,  `add_agent!(agent::AbstractAgent, pos::ValidPos, model::ABM)`  and
  `add_agent!(agent::AbstractAgent, model::ABM)`  have been deprecated.
- `ContinuousAgent{D}` is not a concrete type anymore. The new interface requires two parameters
  `ContinuousAgent{D,T}` where `T` is any `AbstractFloat` type. If you want to use a type different
  from `Float64`, you will also need to change the type of the `ContinuousSpace` extent accordingly.
  Agents in `ContinuousSpace` now require `SVector` for their `pos` and `vel` fields instead of `NTuple`.
  Using `NTuple`s in `ContinuousSpace` is now deprecated.
- Several performance improvements all across the board.
