    abmplot(model::ABM; kwargs...) → fig, ax, abmobs
    abmplot!(ax::Axis/Axis3, model::ABM; kwargs...) → abmobs

Plot an agent based model by plotting each individual agent as a marker and using
the agent's position field as its location on the plot. The same function is used
to make custom composite plots and animations for the model evolution
using the returned `abmobs`. `abmplot` is also used to launch interactive GUIs for
evolving agent based models, see "Interactivity" below.

See also [`abmvideo`](@ref) and [`abmexploration`](@ref).

## Keyword arguments

### Agent related
* `agent_color, agent_size, agent_marker` : These three keywords decide the color, size, and marker, that
  each agent will be plotted as. They can each be either a constant or a *function*,
  which takes as an input a single agent and outputs the corresponding value. If the model
  uses a `GraphSpace`, `agent_color, agent_size, agent_marker` functions instead take an *iterable of agents* in each
  position (i.e. node of the graph).

  Using constants: `agent_color = "#338c54", agent_size = 15, agent_marker = :diamond`

  Using functions:
  ```julia
  agent_color(a) = a.status == :S ? "#2b2b33" : a.status == :I ? "#bf2642" : "#338c54"
  agent_size(a) = 10rand()
  agent_marker(a) = a.status == :S ? :circle : a.status == :I ? :diamond : :rect
  ```
  Notice that for 2D models, `agent_marker` can be/return a `Makie.Polygon` instance, which plots each agent
  as an arbitrary polygon. It is assumed that the origin (0, 0) is the agent's position when
  creating the polygon. In this case, the keyword `as` is meaningless, as each polygon has
  its own size. Use the functions `scale, rotate_polygon` to transform this polygon.

  3D models currently do not support having different markers. As a result, `agent_marker` cannot be
  a function. It should be a `Mesh` or 3D primitive (such as `Sphere` or `Rect3D`).
* `offset = nothing` : If not `nothing`, it must be a function taking as an input an
  agent and outputting an offset position tuple to be added to the agent's position
  (which matters only if there is overlap).
* `agentsplotkwargs = ()` : Additional keyword arguments propagated to the function that 
  plots the agents (typically `scatter!`).

### Preplot related
* `heatarray = nothing` : A keyword that plots a model property (that is a matrix)
  as a heatmap over the space.
  Its values can be standard data accessors given to functions like `run!`, i.e.
  either a symbol (directly obtain model property) or a function of the model.
  If the space is `AbstractGridSpace` then matrix must be the same size as the underlying
  space. For `ContinuousSpace` any size works and will be plotted over the space extent.
  For example `heatarray = :temperature` is used in the Daisyworld example.
  But you could also define `f(model) = create_matrix_from_model...` and set
  `heatarray = f`. The heatmap will be updated automatically during model evolution
  in videos and interactive applications.
* `heatkwargs = NamedTuple()` : Keywords given to `Makie.heatmap` function
  if `heatarray` is not nothing.
* `add_colorbar = true` : Whether or not a Colorbar should be added to the right side of the
  heatmap if `heatarray` is not nothing. It is strongly recommended to use `abmplot`
  instead of the `abmplot!` method if you use `heatarray`, so that a colorbar can be
  placed naturally.
* `static_preplot!` : A function `f(ax, abmplot)` that plots something after the heatmap
  but before the agents.
* `spaceplotkwargs = NamedTuple()` : keywords utilized when plotting the space. 
  Directly passed to
  * `OSMMakie.osmplot!` if model space is `OpenStreetMapSpace`.
  * [`GraphMakie.graphplot!`](https://graph.makie.org/stable/#GraphMakie.graphplot)
  if model space is `GraphSpace`.
* `adjust_aspect = true`: Adjust axis aspect ratio to be the model's space aspect ratio.
* `enable_space_checks = true`: Set to `false` to disable checks related to the model
  space.

The stand-alone function `abmplot` also takes two optional `NamedTuple`s named `figure` and
`axis` which can be used to change the automatically created `Figure` and `Axis` objects.

# Interactivity

## Evolution related
* `add_controls::Bool`: If `true`, `abmplot` switches to "interactive application" mode.
  This is by default `true` if the model contains either `agent_step!` or `model_step!`.
  The model evolves interactively using `Agents.step!`.
  The application has the following interactive elements:
  1. "step": advances the simulation once for `spu` steps.
  1. "run": starts/stops the continuous evolution of the model.
  1. "reset model": resets the model to its initial state from right after starting the
     interactive application.
  1. Two sliders control the animation speed: "spu" decides how many model steps should be
     done before the plot is updated, and "sleep" the `sleep()` time between updates.
* `enable_inspection = add_controls`: If `true`, enables agent inspection on mouse hover.
* `spu = 1:50`: The values of the "spu" slider.
* `params = Dict()` : This is a dictionary which decides which parameters of the model will
  be configurable from the interactive application. Each entry of `params` is a pair of
  `Symbol` to an `AbstractVector`, and provides a range of possible values for the parameter
  named after the given symbol (see example online). Changing a value in the parameter
  slides is only propagated to the actual model after a press of the "update" button.

## Data collection related
* `adata, mdata, when`: Same as the keyword arguments of `Agents.run!`. If either or both
  `adata, mdata` are given, data are collected and stored in the `abmobs`,
  see [`ABMObservable`](@ref). The same keywords provide the data plots
  of [`abmexploration`](@ref). This also adds the button "clear data" which deletes
  previously collected agent and model data by emptying the underlying
  `DataFrames` `adf`/`mdf`. Reset model and clear data are independent processes.

See the documentation string of [`ABMObservable`](@ref) for custom interactive plots.

    ABMObservable(model; adata, mdata, when) → abmobs

`abmobs` contains all information necessary to step an agent based model interactively.
It is also returned by [`abmplot`](@ref).

Calling `Agents.step!(abmobs, n)` will step the model for `n` using the provided
`agent_step!, model_step!` cotained in the model as in [`Agents.step!`](@ref).

The fields `abmobs.model, abmobs.adf, abmobs.mdf` are _observables_ that contain
the [`AgentBasedModel`](@ref), and the agent and model dataframes with collected data.
Data are collected as described in [`Agents.run!`](@ref) using the `adata, mdata, when`
keywords. All three observables are updated on stepping (when it makes sense).
The field `abmobs.s` is also an observable containing the current step number.

All plotting and interactivity should be defined by `lift`ing these observables.

    abmexploration(model::ABM; alabels, mlabels, kwargs...)

Open an interactive application for exploring an agent based model and
the impact of changing parameters on the time evolution. Requires `Agents`.

The application evolves an ABM interactively and plots its evolution, while allowing
changing any of the model parameters interactively and also showing the evolution of
collected data over time (if any are asked for, see below).
The agent based model is plotted and animated exactly as in [`abmplot`](@ref),
and the `model` argument as well as splatted `kwargs` are propagated there as-is.
This convencience function *only works for aggregated agent data*.

Calling `abmexploration` returns: `fig::Figure, abmobs::ABMObservable`. So you can save
and/or further modify the figure and it is also possible to access the collected data
(if any) via the `ABMObservable`.

Clicking the "reset" button will add a red vertical line to the data plots for visual
guidance.

## Keywords arguments (in addition to those in `abmplot`)
* `alabels, mlabels`: If data are collected from agents or the model with `adata, mdata`,
  the corresponding plots' y-labels are automatically named after the collected data.
  It is also possible to provide `alabels, mlabels` (vectors of strings with exactly same
  length as `adata, mdata`), and these labels will be used instead.
* `figure = NamedTuple()`: Keywords to customize the created Figure.
* `axis = NamedTuple()`: Keywords to customize the created Axis.
* `plotkwargs = NamedTuple()`: Keywords to customize the styling of the resulting
  [`scatterlines`](https://makie.juliaplots.org/dev/examples/plotting_functions/scatterlines/index.html) plots.

    abmvideo(file, model; kwargs...)

This function exports the animated time evolution of an agent based model into a video
saved at given path `file`, by recording the behavior of the interactive version of
[`abmplot`](@ref) (without sliders).
The plotting is identical as in [`abmplot`](@ref) and applicable keywords are propagated.

## Keywords
* `spf = 1`: Steps-per-frame, i.e. how many times to step the model before recording a new
  frame.
* `framerate = 30`: The frame rate of the exported video.
* `frames = 300`: How many frames to record in total, including the starting frame.
* `title = ""`: The title of the figure.
* `showstep = true`: If current step should be shown in title.
* `figure = NamedTuple()`: Figure related keywords (e.g. resolution, backgroundcolor).
* `axis = NamedTuple()`: Axis related keywords (e.g. aspect).
* `recordkwargs = NamedTuple()`: Keyword arguments given to `Makie.record`.
  You can use `(compression = 1, profile = "high")` for a higher quality output,
  and prefer the `CairoMakie` backend.
  (compression 0 results in videos that are not playable by some software)
* `kwargs...`: All other keywords are propagated to [`abmplot`](@ref).
