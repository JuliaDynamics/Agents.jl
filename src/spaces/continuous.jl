"""
    ContinuousSpace(extent::NTuple{D, <:Real}; kwargs...)
Create a `D`-dimensional `ContinuousSpace` in range 0 to (but not including) `extent`.
Your agent positions (field `pos`) must be of type `NTuple{D, <:Real}`,
and it is strongly recommend that agents also have a field `vel::NTuple{D, <:Real}` to use
in conjunction with [`move_agent!`](@ref). Use [`ContinuousAgent`](@ref) for convenience.

`ContinuousSpace` is a representation of agent dynamics on a continuous medium
where agent position, orientation, and speed, are true floats.
In addition, support is provided for representing spatial properties in a model
that contains a `ContinuousSpace`. Spatial properties (which typically are contained in
the model properties) can either be functions of the position vector, `f(pos) = value`,
or `AbstractArrays`, representing discretizations of
spatial data that may not be available in analytic form. In the latter case,
the position is automatically mapped into the discretization represented by the array.
Use [`get_spatial_property`](@ref) to access spatial properties in conjunction with
`ContinuousSpace`.

See also [Continuous space exclusives](@ref) on the online docs for more functionality.
An example using continuous space is the [Flocking model](@ref).

## Distance specification
Distances specified by `r` in functions like [`nearby_ids`](@ref) are always based
on the Euclidean distance between two points in `ContinuousSpace`.

In `ContinuousSpace` `nearby_*` searches are accelerated using a grid system, see
discussion around the keyword `spacing` below. [`nearby_ids`](@ref) is not an exact
search, but can be a possible over-estimation, including agent IDs whose distance
slightly exceeds `r` with "slightly" being as much as `spacing`.
If you want exact searches use the slower [`nearby_ids_exact`](@ref).

## Keywords
* `periodic = true`: Whether the space is periodic or not. If set to
  `false` an error will occur if an agent's position exceeds the boundary.
* `spacing::Real = minimum(extent)/20`: Configures an internal compartment spacing that
  is used to accelerate nearest neighbor searches like [`nearby_ids`](@ref).
  The compartments are actually a full instance of `GridSpace` in which agents move.
  All dimensions in `extent` must be completely divisible by `spacing`.
  There is no best choice for the value of `spacing` and if you need optimal performance
  it's advised to set up a benchmark over a range of choices. The finer the spacing,
  the faster and more accurate the inexact version of `nearby_ids` becomes. However,
  a finer spacing also means slower `move_agent!`, as agents change compartments more often.
* `update_vel!`: A **function**, `update_vel!(agent, model)` that updates
  the agent's velocity **before** the agent has been moved, see [`move_agent!`](@ref).
  You can of course change the agents' velocities
  during the agent interaction, the `update_vel!` functionality targets spatial force
  fields acting on the agents individually (e.g. some magnetic field).
  If you use `update_vel!`, the agent type must have a field `vel::NTuple{D, <:Real}`.

Resolve a (hypothetical) elastic collision between the two agents `a, b`.

Their velocities (field `vel`) are adjusted for an elastic collision happening between them.
This function works only for two dimensions.
Notice that collision only happens if both disks face each other, to avoid

If `f` is a `Symbol`, then the agent property `f`, e.g. `:mass`, is taken as a mass
to weight the two agents for the collision. By default no weighting happens.

One of the two agents can have infinite "mass", and then acts as an immovable object
that specularly reflects the other agent. In this case momentum is not
conserved, but kinetic energy is still conserved.

Return a boolean encoding whether the collision happened.

# interacting pairs
#######################################################################################
"""
    interacting_pairs(model, r, method; scheduler = model.scheduler) → piter
Return an iterator that yields **unique pairs** of agents `(a, b)` that are close
neighbors to each other, within some interaction radius `r`.

This function is usefully combined with `model_step!`, when one wants to perform
some pairwise interaction across all pairs of close agents once
(and does not want to trigger the event twice, both with `a` and with `b`, which
would be unavoidable when using `agent_step!`). This means, that if a pair
`(a, b)` exists, the pair `(b, a)` is not included in the iterator!

Use `piter.pairs` to get a vector of pair IDs from the iterator.

The argument `method` provides three pairing scenarios
- `:all`: return every pair of agents that are within radius `r` of each other,
  not only the nearest ones.
- `:nearest`: agents are only paired with their true nearest neighbor
  (existing within radius `r`).
  Each agent can only belong to one pair, therefore if two agents share the same nearest
  neighbor only one of them (sorted by distance, then by next id in `scheduler`) will be
  paired.
- `:types`: For mixed agent models only. Return every pair of agents within radius `r`
  (similar to `:all`), only capturing pairs of differing types. For example, a model of
  `Union{Sheep,Wolf}` will only return pairs of `(Sheep, Wolf)`. In the case of multiple
  agent types, e.g. `Union{Sheep, Wolf, Grass}`, skipping pairings that involve
  `Grass`, can be achived by a [`scheduler`](@ref Schedulers) that doesn't schedule `Grass`
  types, i.e.: `scheduler(model) = (a.id for a in allagents(model) if !(a isa Grass))`.

The following keywords can be used:
- `scheduler = model.scheduler`, which schedulers the agents during iteration for finding
  pairs. Especially in the `:nearest` case, this is important, as different sequencing
  for the agents may give different results (if `b` is the nearest agent for `a`, but
  `a` is not the nearest agent for `b`, whether you get the pair `(a, b)` or not depends
  on whether `a` was scheduelr first or not).
- `nearby_f = nearby_ids_exact` is the function that decides how to find nearby IDs
  in the `:all, :types` cases. Must be `nearby_ids_exact` or `nearby_ids`.

Example usage in [https://juliadynamics.github.io/AgentsExampleZoo.jl/dev/examples/growing_bacteria/](@ref).

    get_spatial_index(pos, property::AbstractArray, model::ABM)
Convert the continuous agent position into an appropriate `index` of `property`, which
represents some discretization of a spatial field over a [`ContinuousSpace`](@ref).

The dimensionality of `property` and the continuous space do not have to match.
If `property` has lower dimensionality than the space (e.g. representing some surface
property in 3D space) then the front dimensions of `pos` will be used to index.
